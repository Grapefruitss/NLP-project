"""I want to be in charge of stable traffic control at KT, which opens the era of GigaTopia."" It was an indescribable pleasure when I heard the beep sound, which was a successful connection to HiTel by entering ATDT 01410 through a terminal program called 'Story' when I was a child. Due to that influence, I dreamed of a career in the telecommunications industry that connects people and provides convenience to customers. KT was fascinated by the fact that it pioneered the convergence market by announcing five major convergence industries. As the VR and IoT markets are predicted to generate more than four times more traffic, I want to help increase coverage by applying for network jobs where my capabilities can be exercised. ""Two reasons to perform my job well."" 1. While taking the data communication course, I was able to learn the principles of TDMA, FDMA, and WCDMA based on my understanding of the physical layer of OSI 7 layer and TCP/IP protocol. 2. While taking the computer network course, I programmed to count data packets from Ubuntu based on Linux to Gedit. We were able to analyze the packets in Wireshark, see if the NIC needed a MAC address and an IP address, and learn through which algorithms the packets were routed. In order to make the network work better, we will provide convenience to our customers by obtaining server certificates and CCNP and CCIE certificates. Before transferring to ""Learn collaboration through projects,"" I was in charge of a project to build a database to measure overall programming knowledge and literacy using SQL language in the undergraduate computer room. The subject of the project at that time was book management. My task was to build a database, command and supervise. The biggest problem was that we didn't know what we were good at, and the roles were not properly divided. Even if I was busy, I decided to assign more assignments and taught my team members to code basic SQL queries until they were understood. However, the project deadline was approaching, but things didn't go well. I decided to take charge of coding in a new way, judge children's abilities through continuous communication, and take charge of data collection, interview data research, and writing Powerpoint. As a result, everyone was able to get an ""A"" or higher score on the database design project, and I felt that the effort to achieve a common goal doubled compared to when I did it alone. With the theme of ""Seeing the potential as a convergence engineer through the design of graduation works,"" I have implemented graduation works with one master's degree and three undergraduate students, including myself. The reason I chose this method was that, unlike conventional manual systems, users could remotely control it wirelessly. My role was to design the Circuit Orcad by reading the Data Sheet on each chip. When I pressed each button of the cell phone, the signal was a combination of two frequencies, which was to design an input/output control design algorithm from 0 to 7 corresponding to ATMEGA 128 by installing a DTMF chip to convert an analog signal into a digital signal. In addition, we installed an ISD 2560 voice recording chip to record the occurrence of the notice when pressing the button with voice, but noise occurred and we used a program called Voice Ware that converts voice when entering text. However, there was a wide difference between algorithm writing and the actual code, and to solve this problem, we had meetings with graduate students more than three times a week and received feedback on what needed to be improved, but it didn't have much effect. I referred to related cafes and major books but it didn't improve. By analyzing the timing diagram of the clock cycle in a new way, I was able to lower it to the microsecond to complete it. As a result, we were able to achieve the achievement of 'second place in the department'. It was a project to increase the gauge by injecting coins and charging gas. My role was simple to bring about a huge arrangement with shift commands, but I demanded patience because it was repetitive. The problem was that there were difficulties in communication, and there were difficulties in carrying out projects that I often missed even at meetings. We held an SNS meeting to solve this problem. International students had different schedules per language school. I wanted to create synergy, so I decided to share the amount of coding.We were able to take pictures and share each other's progress on SNS and proceed with the project. The project was able to get a 'full score' and I think what I gained was that the attitude of collaborating through analysis was also important. Based on these strengths, I want to contribute to leading the convergence industry with KT, which leads the standardization of 5G."
"""Necessity of security I felt in real life"" As an electronic student, I spent a lot of time using computers for assignments, studies, and team projects. As I downloaded files necessary for development or looked for reference materials from foreign sites, I was often infected with malicious code and found certain sites that kept popping up or slowed down a lot. When I was busy and didn't listen to the computer, I became stressed out. I personally experienced that there is nothing that can't be done without such strict security, and that I'll be under stress that I won't be able to do. In addition, if the security issue is not resolved, services that connect to security are not even available. As I have felt the importance of security in person, I want to study and develop security technology at the best AhnLab in Korea so that I don't get stressed by viruses. Not only that, but I also want to go beyond developing myself, and become a person who knows how to worry about the inconveniences real people have. ""Life-threatening 5G Homework"" With the start of the 5G era, the use of numerous devices will be expanded to include smart homes and smart cities for industrial purposes as the IoT of various sizes becomes possible. However, these 5G services cannot be supported without security certainty. Large-scale devices communicate with each other to collect, analyze, and send feedback because if any one of the processes is not properly guarded, it can have fatal consequences. Malicious attacks on the most popularly anticipated service, 'autonomous car' service, can threaten people's lives if you control the vehicle. Security issues are also very important in terms of the development of 'U-Health-Care', which has the potential to be characterized by 'large-capacity communication' of 5G. From this point of view, I thought I should pay more attention to network security solutions and think about their response. 'Solutions, Steps in the Evil Cycle' Two of the three members, except me, were not interested in coding. I was interested in SW development and was studying it steadily, so it was a little easier to catch a big flow or understand the code. As a result, the progress of the project began to differ, and the members of the group lost more interest, and I became frustrated with the slow progress and became a vicious cycle. I could have just asked them to do it because we divided the roles, but I didn't think it would solve the fundamental problem. Since then, we have met every night and taught our team members how to use basic functions to multi-thread. Therefore, the first progression started slowly, but the team members who have thoroughly mastered the basics have grown by implementing more and more codes, and later on, they have helped me in areas where I had difficulties. Thanks to the step-by-step process without giving up, I was able to achieve A+ grades that only two teams received in this class. If there is something given ""until it doesn't work,"" I will challenge myself until I succeed after experiencing several failures. Although I was tired of studying too much in the semester when I was learning six majors, I did not give up and studied until the dawn without letting go until I realized the contents. Since the 2nd grade when I started learning my major, I have developed and made efforts on my own, and I was able to get a score of 4.5 points in the previous semester. I will become an employee who is helpful in the growth of AhnLab through honesty and persistence toward these goals. ""The ability to cope with experiences"" I think various experiences are important in SW development. This is because I think I grow by encountering various errors, thinking about how to cope with them, and coding by myself. Knowing the importance of experience, I have done various SW projects during my studies. I tried to gain my own experience by developing CRunning games, IoT for the elderly living alone, and posture correction projects, and I was able to learn a lot from this."
"I want to work for a company that can continue to grow and work together in the future without being complacent about the reality of ""Samsung Electronics leading the semiconductor industry."" I applied because I thought that it best fits my company's selection criteria. In order to lead the semiconductor market, I think it is important to increase the performance and power efficiency of semiconductors. To this end, the circuit needs to be refined by continuously expanding production facilities and establishing production lines. Starting with operating a semiconductor line in Pyeongtaek last year, Samsung Electronics has pushed for an investment of more than KRW 37 trillion to expand its production line. This year, we also started the construction of the EUV line in Hwaseong and introduced EUV equipment necessary for micro-processing. Seeing Samsung Electronics' constant improvement, I have confidence that it is the best company to lead the semiconductor industry in the future. ""Planning efficient production and logistics lines and establishing optimal logic"" My dream is to plan production and logistics lines that can flexibly cope with fluctuations in demand and to establish optimal logic to achieve efficiency. I want to use my accumulated simulation experience and data analysis capabilities to plan a line that can respond to changing demand immediately. In addition, I want to lead the smooth flow of the line by properly maintaining the craftsmanship and establishing a logic that evenly produces each step. Through this, I want to contribute to Samsung Electronics' leading the semiconductor industry by maximizing production efficiency. ""Posture of perseverance, which turned frustration into a sense of achievement."" When I was in middle school, I got good grades and went to a private high school. However, upon entering the school, my grades dropped sharply among prominent friends, and I experienced great frustration with the low rank I received for the first time. I decided that I could not remain frustrated in this state, so I set my goal to receive a scholarship for excellent grades and worked steadily. To develop my physical strength, I went to the playground every morning, and first arrived in the classroom to study. When I was discouraged, I tried patiently to achieve a sense of accomplishment, not frustration, by reminding myself of my goals again. As a result, my grades improved the most and I was able to receive two scholarships for excellent grades at school. Through this, I learned that the attitude of perseverance allows me to achieve my desired goals, and I am still practicing this attitude and developing myself. ""Achieving High Completion Through Voluntary Challenges"" University has also been successfully carrying out various projects with a persistent attitude. Among them, the most memorable was the experience of completing a GUI program that mediates safe rooms with Python. It was the most meaningful because it was something I challenged myself to do. I was given a project to design a business model in industrial engineering experiments, so I had the experience of designing a system that mediates safe rooms. I could have stopped at simply designing a project, but I became motivated to implement it with a program myself. I wanted to implement a high-quality system with Python, which I was usually interested in. The system was a system that counts the number of nearby safety facilities such as police stations, convenience stores, and CCTVs through location data, starting with the buildings for sale, and then converts them into safety levels and mediates them from a high ranking. Since I had never used Python before, there were many difficulties in implementing the system. In particular, there was a problem in the part dealing with the GUI program and the part linking the database and Python. However, I did not give up, and I worked patiently to lay the groundwork and strengthen it. In order to improve my lack of programming skills, I first applied for and took a software practice. I wrote various algorithms and laid the foundation by creating calculators myself with GUI programs. After that, I looked for major books and looked for solutions to errors by asking the professor. Through this, I was able to successfully get SQL query statements in Python and complete the program by obtaining safety from processed data. As a result, in a survey on the intention to use the completed program, more than 90% of people answered that they were willing to use it, resulting in meaningful results. Through this persistent attitude, I was able to achieve high-quality project results and further develop my ability to handle Python. I will maintain this attitude even after joining the company, contributing to Samsung Electronics' further growth. ""Necessity of gun control seen through shootings in the United States."" Following Las Vegas in October last year, a number of people were killed in Florida in the United States in February this year. Due to the continuous mass shootings, anti-gun public opinion is strongly formed in the U.S., with gun control campaigns and rallies held. Upon hearing these news, I also sympathized with the feelings of U.S. citizens who want to strengthen regulations as a citizen, and I believe that various laws that strengthen gun regulations should be passed as soon as possible. Currently, President Trump is avoiding citizens' calls for stricter regulations, mentioning only the criminal's mental problems. However, as the president of a country, I think we need to listen to the needs of citizens and public opinion and come up with a plan to collect them. Currently, the National Gun Association (NRA) is being discussed as the biggest reason why gun control cannot be strengthened. The NRA has a great influence on American politics through its sponsorship of politicians. Because of this, politicians sponsored by the NRA have not passed the bill against the bill on gun control. In order to solve this problem, I think the safety of citizens as a citizen of the country should be considered first before politicians in the U.S. think of sponsorship. In the future, I believe that various citizens, including the wealthy, should also become sponsors and consider ways to reduce their influence in response to the NRA's political power. Through this, I believe that legislation to ban the sale of offensive weapons and strengthen the registration of gun vendors and the identification of gun buyers should also be revived.Through these efforts, we hope that gun control in the United States will be strengthened quickly and that there will be no more victims of gun incidents. The system development department ""achieve system efficiency through data analysis and simulation"" is responsible for planning production and logistics lines and implementing optimal scheduling through simulation. Through this, we are operating automated systems efficiently and increasing productivity. I believe that data analysis and simulation skills are necessary to perform these roles. When I was an undergraduate, I developed my skills by working on various projects. I first thought that statistical knowledge was necessary for data analysis, so I took reliability engineering and learned about hypothesis testing. After that, I majored in software engineering and learned database and R data mining, and then applied what I learned by analyzing home sales price data in Regression. Through this, I was able to acquire techniques for collecting and analyzing data, and through statistical knowledge, I was able to select valuable data and verify that the analysis was performed correctly. I have experience in implementing bus-drone delivery systems through simulation in industrial engineering comprehensive design projects in order to improve my simulation skills. The project's topic was to come up with a plan to commercialize the drone delivery system. Our group wanted to commercialize a delivery system that combines a bus and a drone by enabling long-distance delivery and reducing the risk of collision. In order to find a process that minimizes the delivery time of goods after the conceptual design, we set various drone travel routes and simulated them. As a result, we were able to analyze that the route designed in consideration of the receipt time of the goods as a top priority minimizes the total delivery time, and based on this, we completed the bus-drone delivery system. Based on this simulation experience, we will model efficient production and logistics lines. In addition, we will analyze the data and establish an optimal scheduling that can respond to any changes. Through this, we will become employees who contribute to increasing productivity as much as possible by implementing an efficient system."
"I applied because I wanted to join Lotte Information and Communication in becoming an ICT company that leads the future of digital distribution. Currently, Lotte Group is innovating distribution by integrating new technologies by realizing 'intelligent shopping advisor' and 'intelligent decision support platform'. In particular, Lotte Information and Communication is in charge of building an AI-based platform, and the establishment of an IT service that integrates the entire group showed its expertise in big data development. I am interested in big data development, so I have developed my data architect's capabilities by working on a project to build a Hadoop distributed processing platform using AWS. I think the value of the existence of big data is to derive results that can provide beneficial value to everyone. Since distribution is the daily life of all customers, all services provided reach the skin. Therefore, I applied for Lotte Information and Communication, which realized the convergence of customer data and distribution, with confidence that it is a company that can best demonstrate my interest and capabilities. I have built my own career by 'challenging' a new field for my dream. When I was in my second year of college, I was very interested in big data analysis that looked into the future by reading a book called Signal and Noise. I thought that the core basis of big data analysis was to build a platform for storing and processing vast amounts of data, so I dreamed of becoming a data engineer. To this end, I challenged the Java & big data developer training course to start a new field called IT. First, I set my goal to be proficient in Java. I tried to learn about the Java API for the first time through code refactoring and implemented programs such as landmine discovery and multi-chatting. Furthermore, by completing the 'academy management program' Java GUI project and the 'society baseball team website' MVC2 project, I was able to acquire the ability to build Java and various web development languages, Oracle DB, and spring framework. After completing the training, I was very interested in storing and processing big data and immediately started studying Hadoop. I learned MapReduce, Pig, Hive, and Hbase in a CentOS-based Linux environment, and grew interest by analyzing vast amounts of data such as Seoul bus rides and U.S. aviation data. Based on the learned knowledge, I built a Hadoop cluster using AWS EC2 and am currently learning Scala by working on an EMR-based Spark MLib project. I want to grow into a data engineer who has secured expertise in decentralized and parallel processing architecture by setting goals and demonstrating my strengths in constantly challenging them. I have been a math mentor for nearly three years at a boarding academy, and I have set and implemented a goal to get all of the students in charge to the desired university. While working for a year, I found two problems. First, it was the students' lack of motivation for learning. It was due to poor grades because they did not know how to learn effectively. Also, it was an inefficient teaching method that only conducted scoring and correcting without considering individual levels. I thought that correct learning methods and customized classes would be helpful. So, I set a goal of 'let's allow more students to enter the university they want' through the improvement of the system. To this end, I suggested the direction of improvement to the director. First, in order to teach them the correct learning method, they did not stop solving problems, but always explained 'why' and emphasized logical connection relationships. In addition, we made the solutions by type by hand and helped them to apply them easily. Next, we proposed a customized method to classify them into students who need supplementary classes and those who want simple solutions. The director gladly accepted and delegated all of the students' management authority. As a result, 6 out of 8 candidates in charge increased their grades by more than 10 points and received a grade improvement by two notches. Unfortunately, we did not achieve a dramatic result of going to the university that everyone wanted, but we were able to set a clear career path and have a motivation to learn. With the goal of students going to college, I felt an unforgettable sense of accomplishment as I agonized, moved passionately, and struggled to help. While performing my work, I will always set goals, think about better ways, and challenge myself. Through 'active communication' with my team members, I have experience of successfully completing the daily precipitation prediction project in Seoul. In order to secure the disk space required for the installation of the Hadoop cluster, I was able to think of AWS that rents the capacity virtually, away from the traditional method of using VMware through constant communication with the team members. Together, we collected academic materials and made a manual to learn EC2, and whenever errors occurred in security groups, IP settings, and putty accesses, we always looked for 'why' and looked for solutions. Finally, we were able to complete all the targeted functions by allocating enough capacity to build a cluster. Through this, we achieved two fruits. First, I learned that new insights can be created when many thoughts gather, not alone. I thought of AWS by sharing my opinions on the limitations of the existing method. In addition, I felt the importance of communication by introducing a new environment called EC2. I was able to quickly find and correct errors that occurred by actively asking and giving advice to each other. On the other hand, there were cases where I messed things up due to 'excessive motivation'. From the experience of giving up specialized Data Science education, I learned that excessive motivation can damage the organization. I did not have enough time to participate in the training while working on other projects, so I was not able to fulfill my role. I studied with the help of my team members, but I eventually quit the training because I was pushed by the deadline for the project that I was working on. Since then, I have been trying not to reverse my failure by organizing my schedule on a weekly basis and completing my work according to my priorities. I want to become a data engineer who contributes to the commercialization of all online and offline stores of AI services by establishing DW and data marts that integrate the entire data of Lotte Group.To this end, I thought that the absorption power of new technologies is the most important quality, so I have been interested in the latest IT trends. In order to gain understanding of big data, I acquired an ADsP certificate and learned statistical techniques and R programming. In addition, with my interest in fintech, I have attended fintech conferences, listened to trends and prospects of new technologies such as AI and blockchain, and practiced interest into action. Recently, I have been very interested in L.POINT big data platform, Lotte Members' Hadoop-based analysis parallel system. After joining the company, I will secure expertise by learning open source technologies such as Spark and Zepplin for real-time collection of data. So, we will develop a platform that can collect, process, and analyze not only structured data in real time, and expand it to more customers to lay the foundation for AI innovation."
"""Step for Fintech Professionals"" I applied to Hyundai AutoEver to achieve my dream of becoming a fintech expert. I was deeply fascinated by the process called big data analysis, which discovers meaningful values from the list of meaningless data, and the algorithms inherent in it. Since then, I have taken my major course, Financial Mathematics, and I have a desire to apply mathematically organized theories to financial data. I completed the Java & Big Data Developer Training Course, and through two projects, I developed my web development and IT practical skills. And I gained insufficient statistical capabilities by learning the knowledge of data analysis and how to use R through online and offline lectures. At the Hyundai AutoEver recruitment briefing held by the school, I heard from the HR manager that it is a company with many educational opportunities. I want to learn various data analysis skills such as Hadoop at AutoEver and grow into a fintech expert. That's why I want to be a member of Platform Management of the Big Data Analysis Platform and show my passion. During the development of the MVC2 project, I participated in SW-tech specialized training on Data Science. I studied hard by asking my team members, but I had difficulties that continued in the project, and I had no choice but to concentrate my time. Moreover, I clearly felt the limitations of non-majors in the logistic regression analysis of data machine learning. Eventually, I was forced to give up education due to the deadline. I gave up because I was so disappointed in myself. However, I felt that if I gave up like this, I would not be able to do my job properly wherever I went. Immediately after the project was announced, I started studying data and statistics program R from the beginning through online lectures and professional books, looking back on the situation at the time. I was able to increase my data analysis capabilities by converting my hard memories into a catalyst for development. Through this experience, I developed the ability to think of it as an opportunity to take a new leap forward no matter how hard things go. The biggest advantage is that the positive attitude of ""activity vs excessive motivation"" is. When sharing project roles based on the Java GUI, the server was more complex than other functions, so no one was willing to come forward. So I volunteered and stayed up all night in front of the computer for a few days, eventually completing the server in three days. As I have done so far, I will lead everything I will take charge of after joining the company and do my best to become an autoever. On the other hand, excessive motivation is my weakness. I often took on tasks outside of my ability, which often caused complicated plans or disruptions in my schedules. That is why I have made it a habit to complete the most important tasks in turn by filling out a priority list. As a new employee who completes his/her duties smoothly and strives to self-care, I will become a mainstay who contributes to Autoever. Convergence talents have three competencies. First, I have developed my ability to use formulas and graphs and mathematical thinking skills using MATLAB through numerical analysis and applied mathematics, which are my major subjects. Then, I learned various object-oriented languages including Java, and came to fruition as the Spring MVC2 project. I have developed R data analysis language ability and analysis and insight into data. By combining the three competencies well, I will establish myself as a differentiated developer. ""Eye to examine the world"" I have developed my ability to understand global economic trends. On campus, I have developed basic concepts through economics classes. Externally, I have completed an international economic expert course organized by the Korea Institute of Finance and have developed the ability to read the flow of the global economy. Based on these experiences, I have developed the ability to analyze businesses that accurately grasp the needs of customers in each country. As a developer with economic insight, I want to take the lead in global growth."
"CJ has led numerous success stories with its various technologies in broadcasting/media. CJ Group has many affiliates and has shown success in various fields, and it was an attractive company for me, who wanted to learn more about flexible and broad work. In particular, I applied for this job with a company called CJ Olive Networks because CJ's values and mine matched. It was very attractive to me that CJ's values that value cooperation and various experiences are in sync. CJ Olive Networks is a global ICT company that has led successful IT projects in various fields based on these values. Therefore, I want to join CJ Olive Networks and participate in in information technology service and system work in various media fields directly. I always liked dealing with computers since I was young, and I have never done that in other subjects, but I wanted to learn more about computer classes because my parents begged me. Since then, I have tried to learn anything, including words, documentary practice, HTML, and web editor. Since then, my dream has already been decided as a programmer in the information and communication field. The various strengths that I have prepared for my job are as follows. First, I strengthened my expertise by taking various programming-related classes such as C, Java, and MS-SQL, and I achieved satisfactory grades. And I tried to strengthen my expertise by studying variously regardless of my major field. Second, I worked on several projects while taking these programming courses. I have experience in various projects such as building a book management database, creating an online shopping mall based on HTML/CSS, and playing number baseball games. Third, I analyzed packets and designed county programming based on Linux with WireShark while taking a computer network course. Solid expertise and diverse experience based on this major knowledge will lead to more efficient solutions to job performance. ""I want to work with CJ Olive Networks to realize customer satisfaction."" CJ estimates the domestic IT service market share of the domestic IT service market at about 1.5%. In addition, due to clouding services, the IT business in the domestic market is showing limitations of growth, and as of 2016, I thought that the sales cost of the SM business division dropped sharply compared to last year. I judged that it was important to maintain sales in Korea anymore. I will keep the share of SM business free sales at 10% throughout 2025. I'll explain two capabilities for this. First, I've developed an attitude of leading by example and collaborating. In the database practice project, my mission was to build a database, command and supervision. I didn't know what to do when I was lacking and started the project. In order to solve this problem, they taught me to code basic SQL queries until I understood them. However, the project deadline was approaching, and things didn't go well. In a new way, I decided to be in charge of coding, and I was willing to stay and do it. It changed whether there was anything I could do to help you with. The effort to achieve a common goal has doubled compared to when I was alone. Second, I have developed a sense of responsibility. As a student who manages three computer labs, I have played a role in coordinating between students and the school. The school has adhered to the policy of free printing for students to study, but their rights have been abused. In order to instill a sense of ownership in the students, I suggested an amount of 10 won per page, and the children did not accept it at first, but they continued to persuade me to agree. The school was able to reduce print maintenance costs by 200,000 won per month. Based on these capabilities, I want to become a culture-leading CJ Ein. ""See as an engineer through the design of graduation work."" I once implemented the graduation work 'The Ubiquitous System' with one master's degree and three undergraduate students, including myself. The method I used was that I could directly control the system by receiving the 'mobile phone button'. The existing system manually pressed the button to control the system, but the reason I chose this method was that the user could wirelessly control the distance directly. When I first took charge of designing the graduation work, everyone was busy with the employment season, so there were many cases of scheduling deviations and the work was very slow because they did not understand the sectors that each other could do well. However, I returned the weekend, identified the sectors that we knew each other well, and divided the tasks to proceed with the project. The department I was confident in designed Circuit as Orcad by reading the Data Sheet of each part's chips. The signal generated when pressing each button of the mobile phone was a signal that combines two frequencies. It was to design an input/output control design algorithm from 0 to 7 that corresponds to ATMEGA128 by installing a DTMF chip to convert an analog signal into a digital signal. In addition, the ISD2560 voice recording chip was installed to record the occurrence of a notice when pressing a button with voice, but noise occurred and a program called VoiceWare was used to convert the voice when entering text. However, there was a wide difference between algorithm writing and the actual code, and by analyzing the timing of the clock cycle, we were able to match the microsecond to complete it. As a result of continuous communication and collaboration, we were able to complete the graduation work faster than expected and achieve the result of 'second place in the undergraduate department'. Based on this experience, as a member of CJ Olive Networks, we will identify each other's strengths, prioritize them according to the nature of the work, and support them by allocating tasks. I will become a talented person who can achieve results based on passion that does not give up easily."
"""I'd rather die than live without passion."" In 2014, when I served in the military as a compulsory police officer, I was passionately into something. I was given a position called ""Sumu"" with about three months left after my discharge from the military, and I was responsible for writing documents such as out-of-town activities of the platoon members, the status of the number of dispatched personnel, and the organization of branch representatives in the event of a situation. I've been working as a clerk for about a week, but I thought there were many inconveniences. Due to the nature of the compulsory police, there were frequent dispatch due to sudden situations, but there was a problem that the dispatch time was delayed because it took too long to enter the divisional representative or the status of the number of dispatched personnel. So for a few days, I was wondering, 'How can I shorten the time to write documents?' As a result, I decided to use Excel technology I studied to obtain a certificate, and I decided to make it using a macro function so that all other documents were automatically written down only when the names of the platoon members and the situation of out-of-town activities were written down. Unlike the rest of the members who were off after returning from the night shift or after the situation, I divided my time into one 'passion' to finish it quickly and help the platoon, spending the night and night, and completed it over about a month. In the process, I exchanged a lot of feedback with the platoon members to make better programs. When I worked with the completed program, it was really comfortable, and in fact, the time to write documents was significantly reduced in the event of a situation, and I felt that the dispatch time was accelerated. I was very proud and happy that the program I passionately made could help the platoon. Also, after a few years of discharge, I received several calls saying thank you and that I am still using the program I made, and it was great to hear that. I want to become an intern who is recognized for my ability as a developer at NCsoft by demonstrating my tenacity. When I was in my second year of college, I was interested in the app when I took a lecture called 'Java Application Programming'. Since then, I have purchased books related to Android app development and studied app development technologies, and when I don't know anything, I have grown myself by asking questions on developer sites such as OKKY and Devpia. Now that I have studied app development technologies, I want to actually develop an app. So after thinking about it, I decided to participate in the 'OOO Contest' with my schoolmates and seniors. After several idea meetings, I decided to create an 'IoT Fire Detector' using IoT technology. My role was to develop and design mobile apps, and until the project proceeded, I was worried about 'whether I could actually make the app that I used all the time'. I was also worried about 'can I win the competition with others who already know how to develop apps?' However, when I actually developed the app, I went to the library to read related books, asked questions on the developer site, and overcame the difficulty in carrying out the project by obtaining the necessary information. I found and learned the skills necessary for app development on my own, and I was able to feel a sense of accomplishment when I worked up all night to implement the desired functions. As a result, my overall understanding of the Android app development process and my skills in app development improved, and I was able to get an opportunity to display it at the expo after winning the election. Through participation in this contest, I was able to gain practical development experience in mobile app programming. Not only that, but I realized that it is very important to keep thinking about how to approach it conveniently and efficiently for real users. Since then, I wanted to improve my skills by doing everything by myself, not only client development, but also DB design and construction, and server development, which are the technologies necessary to develop apps. So, I am currently producing a smoking detection helper in a non-smoking area using Raspberry Pi as my graduation work. I am learning how to build and manage a DB using MySQL and PhpMyAdmin, and I am developing a server using PHP and JSP. In addition, I have actually linked Raspberry Pi to the server and DB, and I have linked the server and the app to the server and DB, and I am almost in the completion stage. Through this graduation work, I feel proud that the overall skills and understanding required for app development have improved, and I will learn more about various technologies related to app development from now on. In addition, I am learning Kotlin, which is spreading rapidly, and I am planning to create an app using Kotlin to respond quickly. I am a ready developer who can fully realize the capabilities NCsoft needs. Through this NCsoft internship program, I want to learn experiences that cannot be learned through books and gain practical skills. ""The great ones have a purpose, and others have wishes."" My goal is to become the most professional talent in my development job and become an indispensable person within the department. I think it is the process of adapting to and learning the company by one year after joining the company. I will try to learn from the seniors who are the best experts and adapt to the company. After I finish adapting, I will do my best to improve my application development skills first. As Google adopted Kotlin as the official language of Android in May last year, the company is gradually developing apps using Kotlin, and NCSoft is also looking for talented people who have knowledge about Kotlin, and I thought that they are working on various projects using Kotlin. I am also learning Kotlin now, and after joining the company, I will build enough knowledge to make apps using Kotlin without difficulty. Also, when new technologies or languages are introduced, I will not hesitate to learn and help other employees. Second, I will improve my language skills.I heard that NCsoft is expanding its mobile game business in Asia, such as Pangya Mobile and Lineage M. Among them, Japan, which succeeded in Lineage 2 as well as the size of the market, is considered an important base for NCsoft. Currently, I am preparing to obtain a JLPT level 2 certificate, and I want to improve my Japanese language skills so that I can be very helpful in communication when working on Japanese services."
"""I will do my best in the manufacturing SI field."" I visited the IT consultation booth at the JobFestival held on campus last year. I met two senior IT development graduates who are incumbent in the SI field. I heard negative opinions about the oversaturated SI industry, but they advised me that the SI industry, which assists the manufacturing industry, which is Korea's growth engine, has a future orientation. Later, I learned about Miracom I&C's manufacturing IT service business. To learn more about these industries, I met with current employees in the industry and found out that my capabilities can be helpful for Miracom I&C's development job. I tried to develop the three competencies necessary for the SW job, and I will apply them to the practice. First, it is development competency. I took JAVA course in web programming and developed 'JSP-based travel sharing community site' as a team project. I was in charge of web design and member database construction of the project. Through this, I developed JAVA language and system development capability. Second, physical strength. During the military service in the computer room, I maintained consistent physical strength by working in two shifts in group 4, answering the phone, and 150 hours of internal and external activities. Third, it is analysis ability. While taking the database course, I designed the 'Hospital Database'. I was able to develop logical analysis ability by setting and printing 20 work process scenarios that could occur in the hospital. ""Activity-Pose to Fill the Shortcomings"" After entering the Department of Computer Engineering, I participated in the 'This is the Java Competition' and set a challenging goal of completing the first project. In the process of achieving these goals, I was very helpful in enhancing the activeness of learning and in how to approach problem solving. When I was a freshman in college, I planned a project to implement 'JAVA-based ATM' at the 'This is the Java Competition'. I aimed to execute the event on that button by using the account creation login, main page and deposit, remittance, and balance check buttons. However, because DB and JSP learning were not available, there was a situation where the login function based on the member data design could not be coded. I tried to solve this problem as follows. I reviewed the development process of the 'JSP-based university lecture evaluation system' through the completion of short-term JSP and DB lectures by IT institutions and Google search. In this process, I found that creating a DAO class, a module that communicates with the DB, and a DTO class, an object used to store individual data elements, was the solution to the login problem. By applying this, I completed the completion and submission, and I have grown into a patient figure who actively solves problems. In the graduation project, which I conducted for 10 months, I presented ideas by demonstrating teamwork and finally realized the results. I encountered two difficulties in the process. The first is the idea planning. Taking advantage of the high issue of fine dust, we planned an app with two team members to measure the value of fine dust, display the measurement area as a Google map, and graph the values. However, the professor evaluated that there was no difference from existing dust measuring stations. After three meetings with the team members, I thought about attaching a dust sensor to the drone, breaking away from the method of measuring in a fixed place such as a measuring station. As a result, the plan was carried out after the professor's inspection three times. The second is the departure of the team member. During development, the team member who was in charge of the UI of the app left, and I thought positively and accepted the reality. I took over the source that the departure team member worked on and reallocated the work. There were cases where I stayed up all night due to an increase in working time, but as a result, it was completed within the deadline."
"""Looking at it with an open mind"" I like to socialize with people. Especially, when I was in elementary school, I liked group activities such as winning second place in a team event at a local swimming competition, and showing demonstration by being selected as a group demonstration team at the OOO kendo competition. Since then, I have interacted with people in internal and external activities during my college days. In the process, I focused on how much I cooperated and communicated with people in those activities. As a result, when the activities were over, I was told by my team members that I was a mood maker, and it was the best thing to hear throughout the activities. ""Conversing with Students in Computer Language"" One week before the opening of my first year of university, there was a program that supported students to learn C language in advance by the school's software project group. It was a great opportunity to learn C language for one week. I was not interested in computer language until I entered university, so I completed the pre-learning, and in the first semester of my first year, I got the result that I showed a beverage vending machine in the console window using a visual studio in a class called programming language and practice. I built up my knowledge by learning my major subjects such as programming application, data structure, and Linux, and I wanted to use them to help students who are interested in IT. So, I have been doing IT volunteer education outside of my second year of university for elementary and middle school students. Using Albert Robot and a Corduroy game program produced by Microsoft, I did activities to improve students' algorithm learning ability. After the activities were over, I answered that I was grateful that the students easily explained the difficult contents at their own level. I was happy to be able to help others based on the major I learned during my college life. With this opportunity, I decided to improve my development ability and provide easy-to-use services for many people. ""Important Customer-Centered Non-face-to-face Channel Services"" As the 4th Industrial Revolution enters, the proportion of non-face-to-face transactions with customers is increasing. In the past, customer behavior was carried out in line with the work process performed at financial branches. However, with the growth of non-face-to-face channel services such as online and smartphones, the work process is now changing around customer behavior. Therefore, it is necessary to be able to make communication with customers commonplace and provide services tailored to customers' needs at the time and in a way that customers want through extensive data analysis on them. Hana Financial TI is focusing on laying the foundation for fintech by establishing FinK, a joint venture between SK Telecom and fintech, to develop artificial intelligence services in line with this trend of customer-centered change. After joining the company, I want to highlight the advantages of the financial business system developed by Hana Financial TI and contribute to ensuring that employees and customers of customer companies who use the business system are not uncomfortable by finding improvements. ""I tried to gain practical experience."" I did not neglect my major learning even though I engaged in various external activities. Through learning my major, I have acquired theoretical knowledge and applied it. Using HTML and JSP learned in web programming classes, we created a bulletin board site that implements login, membership, and writing functions and builds a member database. Through this work, I have gained basic knowledge of the web. Based on these experiences, I worked on HTML modifications such as pop-up and image banners on the intranet for two years in the OO computer room. In addition, by applying the SQL statements learned in the database subject to the Toad tool, the military intranet ID was created, modified, and deleted. After being discharged from the military, I became curious about the management of private companies' websites, so I was in charge of maintaining and maintaining the in-house website using EditPlus in summer field training. This helped me gain practical experience in managing the web system established through this. There is a part of Hana Financial TI's work that manages the computer system within the group. Since each affiliate's website exists, I want to be helpful in managing it. Once you set a goal for ""talent demonstrating sustainable passion,"" you achieve it with all your passion. When I was a third grader in college, when I was taking the embedded subject, I set a goal to calculate a finished product applying theory. At that time, drones were so popular that I proceeded with a project to control drones with controllers using Arduino boards with my team members. I was in charge of planning and C language coding. It was my first time encountering this work, and I had difficulty in proceeding with the code part that controlled the center of gravity of the drone. To solve this problem, I contacted the drone production community operators, and they directly took the drone parts and assembled them with them. In addition, I visited the embedded professor once a week for two months and asked for advice on how to apply the Arduino open source and the pitch, roll, and yaw codes that control the center of gravity. As a result, the drone was assembled perfectly, and later, it was successful to float the drone more than 5m above with the right center of gravity. Through this process, I was able to understand the C language-based theory more accurately. It was also an experience where I gained important knowledge to combine hardware and software. ""We will show you accurate problem diagnosis and practice."" Good developers should have the ability to accurately analyze problems and correct them. As a project, two team members decided to create an app that measures the value of fine dust using a fine dust sensor and a GPS sensor, and displays the measured area in Google Maps. The core of this project was to load the numerical values generated by fine dust sensors into the Android app without any problems. I discussed it with my team member and found that the Wi-Fi shield is compatible with other devices. However, when it is out of the Wi-Fi range, the Wi-Fi shield failed to import the numerical value properly. As a result, I experienced the inconvenience of having to modify it every time with the SSID and password of the Wi-Fi or network provided by another environment.It wasn't easy to replace the Wi-Fi shield we were working on because the interim presentation of the project was only about a week away. With me as the team leader, all the team members uploaded questions to the Arduino community using the information they knew, and we got information that replacing it with a Bluetooth module is convenient to use in any environment and the length of the code will be simplified. Before I bought the module, I tested it in advance with the module you have. As a result of the test, I heard the fine dust value well even when I was moving. With accurate judgment, we completed the parts replacement and app production before the interim presentation. ""We will handle it quickly."" When I worked overtime in the OO computer room, there was a blackout for about 30 seconds in the morning due to bad weather. I learned how to deal with power outages from my senior, so I quickly reported and created a time table. I also went into the computer room server room and checked the status of the web, WAS, DB server, switch, and router, and checked whether UPS was working properly. I completed all reports and inspections, and the next day, I handed over the work safely. I was embarrassed because it was the first power outage I experienced while working, and I was working alone. However, I regained my composure and handled the work quickly according to the manual. This year, Hana Financial TI established the Hana Financial Group Integrated Data Center, which integrates the human and material information technologies of all affiliates in the group. If I become an employee of Hana Financial TI and take charge of managing the server infrastructure, I will try to get used to my work based on my experience in managing the server in place."
"""Work Improvement Activities Using ICT"" I was very attracted to the job of developing and operating ICT, which has already entered our daily lives and is changing our way of life by connecting people and things in various industries such as construction, automobiles, and security. In particular, through the internship, I was able to think about various things about ICT that satisfies the security of important documents of a company and the convenience of performing tasks. I participated in the 'Smart Office Establishment' project to create an efficient work environment using ICT technology. At the idea meeting, we proposed the introduction of a cloud system. I thought that if the information on the work PC is uploaded to the cloud server without storing it on the hard disk, it has the advantage of being able to maintain information security from USB and hacking e-mail infected with malicious code, and perform work anywhere without being restricted by space. The idea received positive reviews and is in the stage of applying it to a real work environment. I have experience of producing positive results through cooperation with incumbent people through talent donation ""Cooperation is the best way to achieve goals."" As an electronic circuit design project, I produced a temperature alarm system. I was in charge of designing a circuit that measures temperature, divides it into three areas, displays it as an LED, and informs it as a BUZZER. The first work I produced did not implement the designed operation. The process of designing and producing a circuit without anyone's help, selecting a device, and producing it was a battle of errors. In order to solve the problem, I requested a talent donation from OOOOOOOOOO, and I was able to get advice from an incumbent electronics manufacturer to solve the problem. Based on that advice, after correcting several errors, I was able to create a work that perfectly embodies the function I was aiming for and received an A+ grade. Rather than thinking of taking everything by myself and solving it, I learned that it is easier and farther away by actively using the people and opportunities around me. We prepared the 'Electric Vehicle Production Competition' by forming an alliance with the mechanical engineering department ""Active Position"". However, due to unexpected circumstances, it became impossible to participate in the competition. This caused a conflict with a team member of the mechanical engineering department. Although it was not a conflict that occurred due to my fault, I asked for an apology and understanding on behalf of the club, and suggested that our team members be dispatched in turns to help prepare for the competition. As a result, I was able to resolve the conflict. I will actively solve the problem situation that may occur in the process of the ICT project before anyone else. ""Disposedness of milk"" It has the disadvantage of spending a lot of time thinking about results and problems that can be planned and predicted before performing something. Deadline is being set to compensate for these shortcomings. I think that these shortcomings can be used to perform more planned and mistake-free tasks by subdividing, predicting, and analyzing the task performance process. I know that communication with department members is the most important task in a company composed of team units of ""The Importance of Communication and Cooperation"". I was able to report on the progress of the work and learn the attitude of actively asking for help in areas in need. I think that the method of collaborating and communicating with the basic skills of organizational life learned through internships will be helpful in planning and improvement activities for ICT projects. ""Major Knowledge and Problem Solving Ability"" I majored in control measurement engineering and applied my major knowledge to my work through temperature alarm devices using temperature sensors, serving robots using infrared sensors and Bluetooth communication, and electric vehicles. In the process, I was able to develop my problem-solving ability through various and constant attempts to reduce errors and defects in project planning and execution ability and performance. I think I can smoothly carry out the new ICT development and project of Hyundai AutoEver using my major knowledge."
"""Woori Bank Becoming a Financial IT Company"" I visited the financial counseling booth at the Job Festival held on campus last year. I met a senior who is currently working at a financial company. In the process of receiving counseling, I was told about the vision of financial IT. After that, I experienced 'WiBitok' and 'WiBibank' in person to confirm my business expansion for fintech solutions and I wanted to work for Woori Bank, which is constantly challenging the fintech market. I tried to develop the three competencies that IT employees need. First, development competency. I took the web programming and JAVA courses and developed 'JAVA and JSP-based travel sharing community site' as a team project. I was in charge of web design and membership database of the project. Through this, I developed JAVA language and system development capabilities. Second, physical strength. During the military service in the computer room, I maintained constant physical strength that did not get tired of work by working in 4 groups of 2 shifts, responding to phone calls, and going backpacking for a month. Third, it is analysis ability. While taking the database course, I designed the 'Hospital Database'. I was able to develop my logical analysis ability by setting and printing 20 work process scenarios that could occur in hospitals. I will become a passionate employee by applying these capabilities to my job. I encountered two difficulties in the team's goal of completing the ""Think differently, finish until the end"" graduation project. First, it is an idea planning. With the high issue of fine dust, we planned an app with two team members to measure the value of fine dust, display the measurement area in Google Maps, and graphically represent the values. However, the professor evaluated that there was no difference from existing dust measuring stations. Through three meetings after that, he thought of attaching a dust sensor to the drone, breaking away from the method of measuring in a fixed place such as a measuring station. Through the drone control, he was able to get the value of dust in the area he wanted to check. As a result, the plan was carried out after three inspections by the professor. Second, it was the departure of the team member. During development, the team member who was in charge of the UI of the app left the team. At first, I was embarrassed, but as a team leader, I quickly took over the source the team members worked on, allocated the work with the team members, and completed it within the deadline. Through this, it was a valuable experience to think differently from the existing method through idea planning and overcome the difficulties encountered in the process of implementing it. ""Activity - Attitude to fill the deficiencies"" The experience of the 'This is the Java Contest' greatly helped in enhancing the activeness of learning and in how to approach problem solving. When I was a freshman in college, I participated in the 'This is the Java Contest' and planned a project to implement a 'Java-based ATM'. I aimed to execute the event on that button by using the account creation login, main page and deposit, remittance, and balance check buttons. However, because DB and JSP learning were not done, there was a situation where the login function based on the member data design could not be coded. I tried the following to solve this problem. Through the completion of short-term JSP and DB lectures by IT institutions and Google search, we developed a 'JSP-based university lecture evaluation system'. In this process, we learned that the solution to the login problem is to create a DTO class, an object used to store individual data elements, in 1:1 correspondence with the DAO class and DB table, which are modules that actually communicate with the DB. By applying this, the completion and submission were completed, and it has grown into a patient figure who actively solves problems. ""Acting silently instead of convenience"" At the time of field training for small and medium-sized enterprises in educational institutions, the CEO gave four trainees the task of creating an NCS curriculum platform for three industries: IT, distribution, and electricity. However, during the production process, the CEO was asked to consider and write various examples on his own when there was a work to list examples and examples of how to write NCS-based self-introduction letters. Several trainees searched the Internet for information about case writing from the middle of the work period, copied and pasted it as it was, and shortened the time. I was also shaken by such temptation, but in the end, even if it took more time to work, I came up with all the examples and wrote them. It might seem silly to others, but I didn't think it was a loss to adhere to the principles with conviction. After that, when I received the final inspection from the CEO, all of the trainees obtained the same result of passing without much criticism. However, I think I maintained the correct attitude by following the principles in that I handled things without using expedients. ""I will experience it more fiercely."" In the short term, I will try to understand and carry out the general employee cycle, such as reception and credit work that I have not experienced through sales work after joining the company. We will increase our adaptability to situations that may occur at customer contact points by utilizing the experiences of communicating and persuading various people from elementary school students to the relevant activity manager in internal and external activities. In addition, based on the knowledge of finance that we have learned steadily on the corporate and bank research websites and the experience of selling veggies on the street and increasing the sales rate by 80% in OO Bank's external activities, we will apply this to the sale of Woori Bank's financial products. In the long run, I will be an IT employee who takes the lead in enhancing the planning power and security of WEB and APPs used by Woori Bank. With the recent release of APPs using new IT technologies such as big data and AI, the use of services incorporating these new IT technologies will be used as part of everyday life in the future. We will become an employee who plans IT services that are difficult for customers to understand more easily and increases security through information protection, big data utilization, and attending security-related seminars that have been completed at universities."
"I have grown through experience. In particular, learning in the college major became more and more curious as the more I tried, the faster I understood and learned. While working on the lab project, I personally felt that the contents I learned through the experience remained easier and longer, and I have tried and tried to learn new things in various ways since then. Also, reading was at the center of my growth. And I wanted to be like a book to others and share my comfort. So, if there is someone around you who cannot adapt or lag behind in work, I tried to be the first to help. For example, during my internship activities, there was a team member who could not keep up with the speed due to lack of individual competency. Fortunately, there is a case in which a project was successful by researching and studying together to provide the maximum help and lead. After the internship activity was successfully completed, I was able to feel the value of solidarity and harmony among the team members. The biggest advantage of my personality is that I have a strong sense of responsibility, consideration, and a strong spirit of challenge. My biggest strength is that I have a meticulous and sincere personality through constant reading, so I keep calm. Because of this, I lacked some quickness. To overcome this, I volunteered to present team projects, answered unexpected questions, and made efforts to develop contingency. When I was in college, I participated in an academic conference and experienced limitless efforts. The thesis was about a new technology, but it was very difficult at the time. I was troubled with a delay of about two weeks from the schedule. However, as a result of constant persistence and persistence, I was finally able to find a solution. I immediately acquired the necessary background knowledge and immersed myself only with passion and persistence. I was able to recognize the concept that the subject was applied using some of the existing things, and through this, I was able to properly transform it and finally complete it. As a result, I was able to complete it within the period and reduced the worries of the two weeks that had been delayed. This created an opportunity to experience the limit of effort for me. It gave me a foothold to grow by strengthening my persistence and tenacity, and furthermore, I developed a sense of adventure and challenge. Since then, I have tried and tried to learn new things in various ways. I looked at the news from time to time to understand the trends, attempted to utilize them appropriately, and was able to play a big role in the process of coming up with ideas and finding ways to improve them. In this way, we will contribute to the company, not to individuals, by examining and analyzing trends that can contribute to the company's development."
"With my endless passion for learning and challenges for new things, I have built my own competence up to this point. After being discharged from the military, I worked harder to study the department, actively asked questions to the professor, and to find out what I didn't know, I went through a scholarship throughout the school year. I was interested in Japanese other than English, so I studied on my own to obtain JLPT N2. And, using my experience as a library manager in the military, I worked part-time on weekends at a city library for a year after discharge, and I learned how to respond to customers and think from their perspective. In addition, for the past three years, I have worked for weeks by musicians while producing album covers as a hobby. Furthermore, by joining a book club and participating in related events, I developed speech to express my thoughts. Until I came here, it was a process that I have been honing and cultivating for the present. Even if I can't produce results right away, if you trust me and keep watching, I will show you good results on the S/W test. There was a problem with the game experience board that was being produced during the fourth-year college graduation project, but obviously, there was a problem that the enemy did not die because the parts (character movement + enemy processing) were combined. And because I didn't know exactly where the problem was, I spent the day looking for errors in that code. What I felt after this day is that QA is important in any aspect. At the company level, it is the final gateway to releasing great products, so it is necessary to carefully review them from the user's point of view, and in the process, a logical explanation is also required to mediate between the developer and the management. To do this, a variety of knowledge about the project is also required. Reflecting on this, in future projects, I always annotate parts that are difficult to think of in the middle of production, or documented and recorded the production process in detail. Through this process, I want to find out if there are errors in S/W so that people don't experience any inconvenience, and at the same time, I have a dream that the image of NHN Entertainment Service is also positively reconsidered. When I join NHN Entertainment Service, as a computer major, I will study about S/W testing and obtain a certificate. At the same time, I will learn practical skills for verification testing. In particular, the current S/W changes rapidly as new technologies are introduced over time, so I will observe trends in S/W as soon as I have a chance. In addition, I will create a method for explaining the logical explanation necessary for the intervention among in-house employees. In addition, I will contribute to the development of NHN Entertainment Service by building theories and practices through in-house training."
"Since childhood, my parents, who are ""supposed OOO,"" have always emphasized the importance of relationships with people. While attending my parents' alumni, fishing, foot volleyball, and other various gatherings, I naturally got along with strangers and learned how to treat adults and the importance of relationships with people. Through this growth process, I became acquainted with my team members easily in the team project, and even team members who did not get along well with each other with smooth interpersonal skills tried to harmonize. When I took a computer science major called advanced system programming, I did a project to make anything with a given board. Since we didn't know each other, we had a hard time because we didn't give out opinions and the morale was low. However, teamwork improved through synergy effect by helping team members who have a low participation rate due to positive characteristics such as happy virus to actively present. As a result, we created an unmanned crime prevention system that informs applications when movements occur by using a camera module, which we have not learned unlike other groups, and we were able to achieve good results amid the professor's praise. Having professional knowledge is important in a large software development project, but I believe smooth communication and interpersonal relationships are the most important things to accomplish. Like pets that have natural affinity and adaptability to become lifelong companions, I will also be the ""favorite"" OOO who grows up with Invenia with my adaptability and affinity. I have experience in hotel housekeeping in Australia with ""built-in responsibility."" When I first started working as a Korean among my Indian colleagues, I had difficulty adjusting schedules or pushing things forward. I did not mind and focused on doing my job. In particular, I took the room where the blacklist guests were staying without a complaint and tried to fulfill their requirements. This resulted in me leaving work later than other colleagues, but it was rewarding to receive not only tips but also letters from some of the guests thanking them. Also, I was able to open my heart to my Indian colleagues by being willing to take on challenging tasks, and was recognized by my boss, and close enough to being invited to a hotel party. Through this experience, I learned that if you do not do your best in your given roles, you can influence others, and that fulfilling your responsibilities is a process of gaining trust from your members. Therefore, I am proud to have a sense of ownership to do the best you can in a given task and situation and have a strong will to solve the situation in the event of a problem. As an S/W engineer, I think unexpected situations will occur frequently. I will become an engineer who can communicate with members with a great sense of responsibility and respond and solve in the best way in any unexpected situation. ""Mission impossible? No, Mission is possible!"" After hearing the professor's remark that the ARM CPU-based operating system debugging tool is stagnant, I have experience of creating a process visualizer that visualizes the data structure of the ARM CPU-based operating system as a graduation work with my colleagues in the academic study related to embedded work and winning the prize in an on-campus competition. By installing ARM-based Petalinux in the virtual machine and dumping and analyzing the physical image, the program aimed to visualize the processes currently running in the virtual machine and information about each process through Python. Many things necessary to create the program, such as Python, Stream Editor, and Qemulator, were unfamiliar, so I gathered with my colleagues twice a week for a year to present about my field of study, shared the necessary knowledge, and took a step forward by having meetings with the professor every week. Finally, we developed a program to visualize more process information than we had planned. While working on this graduation work, I was able to study in-depth information on the structure of the OS and various information on the overall flow process, and based on this work, I participated in a graduation work contest and received an excellence award. ""Similar to the passion of black people"" I have experience working as the head of the planning department of the school's black music club OOO for a year. During our activities, we had to pay for regular performances, which was higher than before. Therefore, we shared the issue with the club members and developed a ""Pork Belly Skewer"" item to be sold during the university festival through meetings. With a clear sense of goal, I and the club members were passionate in sales and promotion, and the reaction was also explosive, so I was able to make a whopping 2 million won in net profit during the festival. It was an experience to enhance the organization's capabilities by sharing my driving force as the head of the club planning department with my members. In addition, while preparing for regular performances on campus, I produced promotional posters that catch people's attention. Compared to what I prepared, there was a regret whenever a small number of audiences came, so this time, I identified the time zone and area where the students on campus moved a lot, and calculated the working hours of the cleaners who removed the posters, and strategically attached the posters. These strategic promotional activities attracted more than 300 audiences for the first time for the club performance, and the record is still unbroken. If I join Slovenia, I will work hard with this passion to become an R&D institute with outstanding expertise and to become the No. 1 company in the world. My motivation for applying to Slovenia is because I think it is a place where I can share my values of 'challenge' and 'sustainable development'. In order to challenge and continue to develop, we wanted to apply to companies with excellent technology, growth through constant research and development, and colleagues who can learn and go out together. Invenia was the first to localize core equipment for all-display processes in Korea, won the $70 million export tower, and was recognized for its industry's best technology, as well as strengthening its systematic capabilities through the credit system and providing various contents by class, and I applied because I thought that it must be a company that can share my values.""A versatile SW expert in Slovenia"" Taking advantage of the strength of the Department of Information and Communication Electronics, I took all major courses such as semiconductor, circuit design, communication, and programming when I was in second grade, and I thought about my career path by learning HW-related knowledge as well as SW. I became interested in S/W field and took related lectures in earnest from third grade. I took C, C++, and JAVA, studied in depth the operating system by taking System Programming and OS as well as Windows Programming, and developed an unmanned crime prevention system program in Embedded Programming and Microprocessor subjects. I have acquired advanced major knowledge for Linux and Embedded S/W research by developing an unmanned crime prevention system program using an arc board. I studied hard every time and was able to receive scholarships for three consecutive semesters with excellent grades in my major courses. I am sure that my versatile experience will be a great help in fulfilling my SW job in Slovenia. After joining the company, I will continue to challenge the SW field with my colleagues like the 'passion of my school days', so that I can become Invenia with the best technology among the manufacturers of display core process equipment."
"While attending university, I have development experience using various languages such as C language, C++, and Python through non-academic projects. First, I have experience in SW development using Python. The scenario of the project is a program that helps to analyze through a visualized program by searching for files equipped with malicious code in embedded equipment. I was interested in the Linux kernel, so I planned the above project during a study meeting. As for the operation process of the program, the Xilinx board is used as guest OS in the QEMU virtual machine, and the target board is restored and analyzed so that the guest OS can be analyzed in the form of a GUI so that the analysis can be made easier by visualizing it in the form of a GUI. Through this graduation work, I was able to study in more depth the structure of Arm-based OS and various information on the overall flow and process, and I had the experience of winning the second prize in the competition by overcoming and completing the lack of knowledge outside my major. Second, I have experience in an unmanned crime prevention system using an arc board. The project scenario is a program that uses a camera sensor attached to the board to capture and output a motion warning message to the user on the Android device as soon as the motion is captured. I called the board company directly, got the manual on the acro board camera, analyzed it, and wrote the code that would cause an interrupt when a motion occurred. I used Python, Stream editor, and acro board in this project, and many other things were unfamiliar to me and new to me. However, after studying for a project for a short period of time, I had the valuable experience of making a planned program, and I had the confidence that if I worked hard, I could do it. Through this confidence and development experience, I will become a developer who can provide excellent service with advanced technology and become an S/W expert who creates new value for my customers. ""Nice to say OOO."" My parents are yard-footed. They have always emphasized the importance of relationships with people since childhood. While attending my parents' alumni and various gatherings such as fishing and foot volleyball, I naturally learned the importance of relationships with people, such as how to get along with strangers and how to treat adults. Through this growth process, I became close to everyone in the team project and tried to harmonize even those who were on the outside with smooth interpersonal skills. When I took a major course in computer engineering called advanced system programming, I did a project to make anything with a given board. At that time, I had a hard time because I didn't know each other well and I had low morale among my team members. However, as a result of actively announcing and accepting the group members who had a low participation rate due to positive characteristics such as the happy virus, teamwork improved due to synergy effect. Therefore, I created an unmanned security system that informs applications when movement occurs by using a camera module, which I have not learned unlike other groups, and I was able to achieve good results amid the professor's praise. Also, I tend to adapt quickly with strong adaptability anywhere. I have the experience of going to Australia for a working holiday. It was my first time in an English-speaking country, so I was frustrated and scared to get a job, but I copied my resume and went around 30 places a day to appeal to myself. After running for about a week, I got calls from various places, and I prepared hard for the interview so I could get a job as a hotel housekeeper. In today's big software development project, having professional knowledge is important, but I think smooth communication and interpersonal relationships are the most important to carry out tasks. Like pets that have natural affinity and adaptability to become lifelong partners, I will be the ""pets"" OOO who grow up with DreamTech with my adaptability and affinity. ""Inbuilt responsibility"" My personality trait is that I am responsible for everything I take on. I have experience in hotel housekeeping in Australia. When I first started working as a Korean among my Indian colleagues, I had difficulty adjusting schedules or pushing them to work. I didn't mind and focused on doing my job. In particular, I took the room where the blacklisted guests stayed without showing any reluctance and tried to comply with their requirements. Although I left work later than other colleagues, it was rewarding to receive thank you letters as well as tips from some guests. I was also able to open up my Indian colleagues by being willing to take on difficult tasks, and I was able to be recognized by my boss and close enough to be invited to a hotel party. Through this experience, I learned that if each person does not do their best in their given roles, they can affect others, and that fulfilling their responsibilities is a process of gaining trust from members. Therefore, I am confident that I have a sense of responsibility to do my best in a given task and situation and a strong will to resolve a situation in the event of a problem. On the other hand, there are some cases where it is difficult to make a firm decision because decisions are prudent in order to solve the situation best every time. In order to correct these shortcomings, I had time to talk with members when I had problems in group life. As a result, I learned that I was close to a rational solution, which allowed me to make a rational decision through conversations at black music clubs and study groups that I belonged to. My prudence became proficient in communicating as well as solving problems through conversation, naturally forming various human networks. As a SW developer, I think unexpected situations will occur frequently. I will be a developer who can respond and solve in the best way in any unexpected situation by demonstrating my communication skills with members with a great sense of responsibility.""DreamTech's versatile SW expert"" Taking advantage of the strength of the Department of Information and Communication Electronics, I took all major courses such as semiconductor, circuit design, communication, and programming in the second year, and thought about my career path by learning HW-related knowledge as well as SW. I became interested in S/W and took related lectures in earnest from the third year. I took C, C++, and JAVA, studied in depth the operating system by taking System Programming and OS as well as Windows Programming, and developed an unmanned crime prevention system program in the Embedded Programming and Microprocessor subjects, and acquired the advanced major knowledge for Linux and Embedded S/W research. I studied with my best every time and was able to receive scholarships for three consecutive semesters with excellent grades in my major courses. I am sure that my versatile experience will be a great help to perform my duties as DreamTech's SW development. After joining the company, I will constantly strive to become a Dream Tech with the best technology by constantly challenging the SW field with my colleagues just like the passion of my school days. ""If you want the present to be different from the past, study the past,"" Spinoza said. This is my most important value. In order to live a forward life, I have not only absorbed new knowledge but also made up for what I felt was lacking, and instead turned it into a strength. In particular, in order to become a good programmer, I have developed my skills in other fields. Among them, I have tried to develop my English skills necessary to become a global talent. After joining the military, I started to make short-term and long-term plans to go on a working holiday. During the rest of my military life, I studied English and conversation in the Philippines to prepare basic skills, spent three months in practical training, and 11 months in Australia to raise money, while also studying English and taking a vacation for about a month before returning home. Immediately after being discharged from the military, I left for the Philippines, and in the first month, I actually used what I learned that day and gave feedback. In the second month, I learned words that I usually use in business, and in the third month, I focused on pronunciation correction. After leaving for Australia, I was recognized for my conversational skills among the best among international students and was able to get a job as a hotel housekeeper in just seven days. Also, although the average international student receives an hourly wage of 10, I was able to work for a minimum of 16 dollars and a minimum of 32 dollars. Even after returning to Korea in February 2013, I constantly participated in English conversation studies, provided detailed explanations when I had a situation to speak, such as asking for directions from foreigners, and I was always able to get feedback such as ""You speak English, very well."" It may not be a great feedback, but I am not only proud that it is a result that I gained from my hard work in my 20s, but I am always making progress to become a global talent by working on everything, recalling this experience. Even after joining the company, I will become a SW developer who constantly develops by studying not only new knowledge but also what I lack."
"My motivation for applying to EZCareTech is that I think it is a place where I can share my values of 'challenge' and 'sustainable development'. In order to challenge and make sustainable development, I wanted to apply to companies with excellent technology, growing through constant research and development, and having colleagues who can learn and go out together. EZCareTech developed the hospital information system as the nation's top medical IT company as the first outside of the U.S. to receive HIMSS Stage7 certification and be recognized for its world-class technology, as well as to operate a career development system according to job areas and levels to ensure that it is constantly developing by operating a career development system according to the job area and level, and I applied because I thought that these parts must be a company that can share my values.

""If you want the present to be different from the past, study the past,"" Spinoza said. This is my most important value. In order to live a moving life, I have always not only absorbed new knowledge but also supplemented what I felt was lacking, and made it a strength. In particular, I have developed my competence in other fields in order to become a good programmer as well as a good programmer. Among them, I have tried to develop my English skills, which are essential to become a global talent. After joining the military, I started to make short- and long-term plans to go on a working holiday. During the rest of my military life, I studied English and conversation to lay down basic skills, spent three months in the Philippines for practical training, and worked in Australia for 11 months to raise money, while studying English and taking a vacation for about a month before returning home. Immediately after I left the military, I left for the Philippines and in the first month, I actually used what I studied that day with my Filipino friends and gave feedback. In the second month, I learned words that I usually use in business, and in the third month, I focused on pronunciation correction. After leaving for Australia, I was recognized for my conversational skills at the top of the class among international students and was able to get a job as a hotel housekeeper in seven days.

It may not be a great feedback, but I am not only proud that it is a result of my hard work in my 20s, but I am also constantly making progress to become a global talent by working on everything, recalling this experience. Even after joining the company, I will become an S/W engineer who constantly improves by studying not only new knowledge but also shortcomings.After joining the ""Global Medical Information System SW Specialist,"" I will build trust in the organization by learning the basic postures and tasks that I must have as a member of EasyCare Tech for one year. I will also focus on becoming one with my team members based on that trust. In addition, I will quickly acquire the skills and knowledge related to WPF and .NET development necessary to complete my duties and acquire the necessary job competency related to research within one year. As an employee with a beginner's mind, I will be an expert who penetrates all the business fields of EasyCare Tech by the time of my third year through constant self-development. I will always try to establish a more complete medical environment by analyzing customer needs and discussing with my colleagues. And in 10 years, I will become an indispensable PM in EasyCare Tech and become a senior developer who is recognized for handling projects quickly and accurately by being in charge of the management of projects in the business department. In addition, I will learn English related to constant English study and business in line with EasyCare Tech's expansion into global companies, such as exporting HIS overseas to large hospitals for the first time in Korea. In the global market, I will further increase the competitiveness of the company by directly communicating information that is difficult to understand in parts other than developers. I think my development is the development of EG Care Tech. I will become an employee who does not settle for the present and constantly strives. ""Similar to the passion of black people"" I have experience working as the planning department head of the OOOO school for a year. During the activities, I had to pay an increased cost for regular performances. Therefore, we shared the issue with the club members and developed a 'pork belly skewer' item that will be sold during the university festival through meetings. With a clear sense of goal, I and the club members were passionate in sales and promotion, and the reaction was also explosive, so we were able to earn a whopping 2 million won in net profit during the festival period. It was an experience to enhance the organization's ability by sharing my driving force as the head of the club's planning department with members. In addition, while preparing for regular performances on campus, I produced promotional posters that catch people's attention. Compared to what we prepared, there was a regret whenever a small number of audiences came, so this time, we identified the time and area where students moved on campus, and calculated the working hours of the cleaners who removed the posters, and strategically attached the posters. These strategic promotional activities attracted more than 300 audiences for the first time in the club performance, and the record is still unbroken. If I join EasyCare Tech, I will work together to become an R&D institute with outstanding expertise and become the No. 1 global company by working with such enthusiasm. While attending university, I have development experience using various languages such as C language, C++, Python, and Perl through non-academic projects. First, I have experience in SW development using Linux. The project scenario is a program that helps to analyze through a visualized program when searching for files loaded with malicious code in embedded equipment. Since I was interested in the Linux kernel, the above project was planned during a study meeting. As for the operation process of the program, the Xilinx board is used as guest OS in the QEMU virtual machine, and the target board is restored and analyzed to enable post-analysis of guest OS in Linux and Windows environments, so that the analysis can be made easier by visualizing and analyzing it in the form of a GUI using Python. By overcoming and completing the lack of knowledge outside my major, I gained the experience of winning the Excellence Award in a competition. Second, I have experience in unmanned crime prevention systems using acro boards. The project scenario is a program that uses a camera sensor attached to the board to capture and immediately outputs a motion warning message to the user on the Android device. I called the board company directly, received the manual related to the acro board camera, analyzed it, and wrote the code that generates an interrupt when a motion occurs. Python, Stream Editor, and acro boards used in the above project were the first things I saw. However, by studying for a short period of time for a project, I gained valuable experience in creating a planned program, and through this experience, I gained the confidence that I can do anything with effort. Through this confidence and development experience, I will become a software expert who generates profits from EasyCaretech by becoming a developer who can provide excellent services in more environments in the era of the 4th Industrial Revolution with advanced technology"
"""Expanding Mobile Payment Platform"" I applied because I wanted to expand GS SHOP's mobile payment platform field further. Specifically, I would like to create the simplest payment process by applying biometric authentication technology and a chatbot system with high response rates to mobile payments. As the home shopping industry has to actively cope with customer satisfaction and changes in trends, related technology development is constantly needed. The recently released 'Right away Payment ARS Service' stands out in that it has further increased the competitiveness of the industry by improving the purchasing process more simply and quickly. This was because the company was able to confirm that it was constantly striving for customer satisfaction and was active in introducing new technologies, so GS SHOP thought it was the best company to demonstrate its capabilities. ""Realistic interest and effort in new technologies."" I have also been paying attention and efforts to new technologies such as big data and artificial intelligence to expand mobile payment platforms. First, with my experience related to big data, I developed an 'IoT-based Facility Failure Prediction System' linked to the manufacturing industry as a graduation project and built AWS servers and influxDB to manage a large amount of data. In addition, I was able to get a certificate by studying Google Analytics, Google's data analysis tool, recently. Second, I have taken an artificial intelligence course, added depth of knowledge, participated in many IT conferences at World IT Show and Softwave Competition, and encountered various new technologies including artificial intelligence. As GS SHOP has set specific goals based on my experience and knowledge, I will become a talented person who performs with all my passion. ""Active attitude and passion that bring about change."" The internship experience to change the existing one more efficiently is an example of the achievement of passion and persistence. Earlier this year, OO conducted the study and design of the precise map data compression algorithm based on C++. The fact that the conventional compression algorithm showed a low compression rate of about 58% at the time, I wanted to design a more efficient algorithm with the question of 'Why?' So first, I wanted to increase the compression rate through the idea of merging the existing compression algorithm with the Dijkstra algorithm, which I personally implemented in the project 'In-school Shortest Path Guidance System' conducted in the software engineering class. Secondly, I asked my supervisor for his understanding, and I wanted to talk about the progress of algorithm implementation every other day and get some feedback. As a result of constantly trying to complete the idea, I was able to design a new algorithm that increased the compression rate to 71%. The 13% increase in compression rate was not a noticeable achievement. However, the evaluation of seniors in the department that they actively came up with ideas and that the attempt was good was the most satisfactory one. In addition, the experience has made me deeply feel that one of the factors that can change the existing one is the active attitude and passion. When I work at GS SHOP, if I can improve the existing one to lead to customer satisfaction, I will do my best to solve even the smallest part. ""Do an IT infrastructure construction project in Indonesia?"" The experience of an IT infrastructure construction project in Indonesia was an experience that allowed me to look back on myself with enthusiasm. Three years ago, I was dispatched to Rampung, Indonesia as a member of OOO Promotion Agency to gain experience in IT projects. My three developer team members and I were assigned to a local university lab for two months, of which I was in charge of DB construction and web development. The project was to build a new 'e-class system' to replace the old version of the class management system, which was completed for four weeks and applied to the demonstration class. However, in the first week of construction, the new system account creation rate was around 20%, which was a very low problem. At that time, I was in charge of DB and web pages that were directly exposed to users, so I felt a greater responsibility and asked myself the question of 'Why?' the most among my various project experiences. To get the answer, I showed my passion to create and distribute a questionnaire equivalent to 120 pages. The main reason was the functional problem in which the submission was shared entirely by everyone and the reluctance to the English screen. After that, our team worked together to solve the functional problem and worked on page translation with two local students. As a result, we were able to increase the account creation rate to 84% when we were two days away from our team's return to Korea. Looking back on our experience, I realized the importance of management as thorough needs analysis and process feedback are essential. My experiences and feelings will be of great help in the development and operation of systems that I will be passionate about in the future. ""Business Understanding, Constant Development"" I want to be the best developer in the home shopping industry who has built the most convenient apps and payment processes. Due to the nature of the home shopping industry, I think that the simplification of using apps and the simplification of the purchase process is directly proportional to sales. In the current situation where biometric authentication technology is developed and simple payment technology is more active, two specific goals have been established to grow together with GS SHOP with the goal of increasing net profit by 15% within five years. First, I will precede the understanding and learning of the home shopping industry. The business of home shopping is a structure in which various systems such as order, payment, and delivery are intricately intertwined. Therefore, we will not only improve or expand the mobile payment system, but we will certainly understand the business concept of home shopping and proceed with the improvement and introduction of new technologies accordingly. Second, based on our understanding of the home shopping business, we will become a developer who constantly learns and develops to improve various processes and introduce new technologies. As the industry is sensitive to trends, it is necessary to understand IT trends quickly and accurately. We will actively review and benchmark the IT strategies of global home shopping companies to establish specific goals for overall optimization and improvement of the GS SHOP system.Summarizing a 15% increase in net profit within five years and two specific aspirations, we aim to establish an optimized home shopping system through a comprehensive understanding of the home shopping industry business, constant learning and external benchmarking. After joining the company, I will become a talented person who constantly develops and demonstrates passion to achieve the specific goals I set."
"""Essential Competencies of S/W Engineers, Convergent Thinking"" The job of S/W engineers is most suitable for me, who has developed 'convergent thinking' by putting IT convergence into practice as a real project. The job of S/W engineers, who need to quickly and accurately grasp the needs of customers in various fields, is to constantly consider what value the convergence of specific industries and IT creates. We have developed convergent thinking by integrating IT into manufacturing and distribution industries, which we judged to have the greatest value of convergence. First, I have experience in developing 'IoT-based Facility Failure Prediction System' linked to the manufacturing industry with OOO through industry-academia cooperation. I was interested in the smart factory, so I wrote a plan and proposed it to the company manager first, and I felt the value of understanding and convergence of IoT and smart factories first. Second, I developed an 'IoT-based traffic assistance device' by incorporating IT technology into the traditional market. I wanted to understand the requirements of merchants in traditional markets far from IT through the opportunity for the free subject project. I analyzed the traffic problem, which is the biggest problem, and planned it with my team members and made products. Upon winning the Presidential Award in the on-campus competition, I learned that IT convergence based on deep consideration is of great value in itself. The task I will be in charge of provides system integration services in various industries. I will also continue to develop convergent thinking that continuously considers applicable technologies. ""Main Language JAVA and Customer-Centered Attitude"" Until now, we have been steadily striving to acquire expertise in the JAVA field. The SW engineering department is an optimal job to demonstrate my capabilities as system planning and development are carried out based on Java. In order to create practical results based on JAVA, I personally learned the Android language to develop my expertise. In particular, my experience of actively using Open API is my differentiated development capability. What I felt from using Open API several times is that it is also an important quality of developers to properly utilize high-quality information according to the situation. Recently, as I felt the importance of the algorithm, I have added my expertise by taking the national education program to train algorithm-based JAVA developers until August. I carried out a project to link 'Inventory Management System' with Oracle DB using MVC pattern in JDBC. After joining the company, I want to steadily learn customer-centered attitude and create a trusted Dongbu Corporation. When I was a bachelor's degree, I had the experience of collecting requirements directly from faculty and staff in a project that assumed my alma mater as a client. From this experience, I learned that it is important not only to complete the system construction but also to meet the detailed requirements. New technologies are constantly emerging and customer needs are diversifying. I will always be a part of the company that considers whether there are any better technical elements to build the optimal business environment from the customer's point of view. ""Improving the efficiency of compression algorithms"" I have overcome the most difficult crisis with my strength and enthusiasm during my internship. Earlier this year, OOO researched and designed precision map data compression algorithms. At that time, I was given the task of improving the 'compression rate' of map data compression algorithms which have a compression rate of about 58%. Although I established a voluntary goal of raising it to 70%, I had no knowledge of basic GIS (Geographic Information System) and there was a limitation that I had to solve it by myself. However, in order to achieve my goal, I took advantage of my strengths in applying my past experiences well when solving problems. As I recall my experience in implementing the Dijkstra algorithm to find the shortest path I have conducted in the past, I made it my first plan to merge it into the existing compression algorithm. The second question was, I freely asked my junior to do so. I asked my supervisor for his understanding and took a lunch break every other day to receive feedback on the implementation of the algorithm and the contents of GIS learning. After five weeks of constant effort, I was able to design a merged compression algorithm that increased the compression rate by 8%. The increase in the compression rate of 8% was not enough to achieve the voluntary goal. However, the evaluation of seniors in the department that they actively came up with ideas and liked the attempt itself was the most satisfying feedback I have ever heard. No matter what difficulties I encounter even in Dongbu, I will actively solve them based on my strengths and enthusiasm."
"Among the numerous companies, CJ Olive Networks' vision is the most consistent with the research experiences I have had. It was attractive to think about creating value in our lives and to expand new areas by fusion of technology, and I applied because I was confident that I could grow with the company. It's interesting to find and learn what you don't know. I constantly attend ICT seminars, IT forums, and developer education, and I am seeing, hearing, and experiencing new technologies. If it is difficult to attend, my biggest strength is that I always understand the flow of future technologies by experiencing them indirectly through IT news articles such as blotter and zdnet. Currently, I am conducting technology-based human-centered research at the graduate school, and I have infinite affection and pride in my research lab. Students majoring in humanities, design, and engineering formed a multidisciplinary team to collaborate together in every process from problem recognition to solutions, and conducted research on HCI, UX, and IoT for two years. Due to the occupancy time of cafe customers, research was conducted in various fields to create unprecedented value, such as subway passenger distribution systems, display smart curating services, and improvement of waiting times for children's hospitals. When working on a project to reduce the experience waiting time at a children's hospital, even though I was an engineer, I also participated in the work of discovering problems by observing it for three days at the hospital. By going to the field, I was able to discover unexpected parts in the desk research process, and by experiencing all processes from the planning stage to the solution stage with humanities and design majors, I was able to cultivate collaboration skills. In this way, I feel proud and attached to technology-based human-centered research, and I am confident that future problems can be solved together even if the experiences that I have solved head-to-head come into the company. When visiting the OOO Museum's permanent exhibition, I have experience launching a smart curating service using the Bluetooth function and beacon of a smartphone. As an industry-academia joint project, I formed a team with one company and majors in planning, design, and participated, and I was able to communicate in a multidisciplinary team to experience the design process and learn design sensibilities. I was responsible for researching indoor location-based algorithms. Initially, Bluetooth signals were used to implement them, but the accuracy of wireless signals was low indoors for actual commercialization services. As a result of the test, the service we wanted was not properly performed, and other methods were needed for better performance. After much consideration, we implemented the algorithm by fusing relatively accurate magnetic field sensors, and we were able to solve some of the problems in terms of accuracy. Through this, we published a number of papers and successfully applied for two patents. I learned that commercialization services are very difficult, unlike projects that were simply developed as demonstrations at schools. The final test process also took a considerable amount of time because errors can lead to customer loss. This is the most meaningful example of convergence technology research because I could experience the process of the creation of new services indirectly by companies such as CJ Olive Networks, and I could also sympathize with the fact that numerous people's efforts follow behind it. I am confident that my experience in designing every process from problem recognition to solutions can help me create values even as a member of CJ. It will be the first mover of ICT, emotional, and design convergence technologies that bring out human communication skills according to the demand of the times that changes based on user experience based on the research capabilities developed through collaboration. Based on the collaboration skills and convergence capabilities acquired through two years of efforts, I want to create new customer value that combines technology and business with CJ Olive Networks. Core technology is included in all products and services, but the ultimate target of technology is people. It will be more meaningful and necessary research if you understand and develop human contexts from the research and development stage. Based on the engineering capabilities of electronics and communications learned in the Department of Information and Communication Electronics, I believe that it will be a great advantage for me to join CJ Olive Networks and conduct convergence technology research. The field I want to study after joining CJ Olive Networks is deep learning. Recently, I am studying deep learning at the same time, and I am also studying various classification algorithms through statistics and data mining classes that support this. In addition, beacon data is collected and analyzed in the project ""Development of Technology to Improve Robustness and Precision in Indoor Location Estimation Technology"". In the ""Development and Validation of Interactive Language Learning Device"" project, we are testing object recognition application demos that have learned 1000 objects and are looking for ways to increase the recognition rate. I hope to grow into the next generation of key technology experts and global leaders in CJ Group. I want to focus on research and development of future technologies of artificial intelligence based on the research capabilities I have been carrying out. Furthermore, I want to create new future industries such as smart factories, smart logistics, omnichannel, and other new customer values by converging core technologies with customer businesses. In order to become an engineer who understands the trend of the times and actively responds to changes, I read more than one trend book a month and set a quantitative goal of publishing more than two papers or patents a year. The field of artificial intelligence, along with CJ Group, is the most active area for research and development in major global companies, and as new knowledge and related technologies are pouring out every day, I will become a researcher at the Convergence Technology Research Institute and try to become a talented person who will challenge by repeating the process of discovering, implementing, testing, and applying new technologies to catch up with and overcome trends."
"""The convergence and collaboration skills that I have learned over the past two years"" Two strengths that I can confidently say are superior to other applicants are convergence and collaboration skills. Core technology is included in all products and services, but the ultimate target of technology is people. It will be more meaningful and necessary research if you understand and develop human contexts from the R&D stage. Based on the engineering competencies in electronics and communications that I learned in the Department of Information, Communication, and Electronics Engineering, I conducted convergence research for two years with my friends who majored in humanities and design in graduate school. Once, a museum conducted a project to apply for a curating service on exhibits. The core technology was to accurately position the BLE signal indoors. We collected and analyzed the wireless signals several times, but due to the nature of the BLE signal, there has been little success for a long time due to its low power and stability. The reason for accurate positioning was to provide accurate services to viewers of the exhibits, but when we looked at the fundamental problems, we found out the direction and behavior of the person, which could be solved. In the end, we were able to solve the problem by fusion of the BLE wireless signal, a relatively accurate acceleration sensor, and a direction sensor. Through this, we published a paper in the International Conference on Convergence Technology 2017 as a result of drastically reducing the false detection rate of BLE signals, and even applied for a patent. When I was working on a project to reduce the waiting time for people to feel, I was also an engineer, but I observed it for three days at the hospital and participated in discovering problems. By going to the field, I was able to discover unexpected parts in the desk research process, and I was able to cultivate my collaboration skills by experiencing all processes from the planning stage to the solution stage with humanities majors. As such, I feel proud and attached to technology-based human-centered research, and I am confident that the experiences that I solved head-to-head will be able to solve future problems together at LG Electronics. I have always done research in the fields of HCI and IoT, as my dream of working in the R&D field of ""First Mover of Convergence Technology"" and creating new things is in my heart. Just as I was always proud when I went home after studying until late at night, I think the joy will double or triple if LG Electronics focuses on the latest technologies and develops them in the future. The HCI field is considered an essential discipline in the 4th Industrial Revolution, but in the case of Korea, it is recognized as a very unfamiliar field as an early stage. It will be the first mover of ICT, emotional, and design convergence technologies that bring out social and human communication skills according to the demand of the times that changes from technology to user experience-oriented. In addition, as the one-person maker era has arrived, I want to become an engineer who understands the trend of the times and actively responds to changes and conduct constant research. In order to achieve the above goal, the goal is to read more than one trend book per month and publish more than two papers or patents per year."
"""Programming and Practice A"" means a lot to me as this is my first major basic course. The C programming language has been used in various fields from general application programming to network, system, and graphic programming because it includes both high-level and low-level languages. Therefore, it is the most basic language, but it is also an essential language that I have learned the longest. Therefore, language C is one of the languages that I am most confident in. It is a valuable subject that I have learned some basic skills as a student majoring in ""Creative Engineering Design A+"" engineering. In this course, I first defined the problem when a certain problem was given, and then I learned the overall contents of the problem-solving process that create an idea, evaluate it, judge it, and put it into action. This course also helped me a lot in developing the necessary skills to become an engineer, which I cannot experience alone. ""Object-oriented Programming Basic A+"" The JAVA language is one of the most widely used languages now, as it has both the advantages of C language and the characteristics of object orientation, which are easy to understand by both humans and machines. This course helped me a lot in developing JAVA language-based Android applications. It is a smart band and concentration game that was created during the ""BeSmart Game"" wearable software competition. We have developed a concentration game that allows for a slight improvement in children with attention deficit disorder by linking a headband and an application that can measure brain waves with an application. I was in charge of developing Android games, but since it was my first project in my life, I had a lot of difficulties developing the Bluetooth reception part. I searched and read books in the library and implemented them by referring to them on the Internet, but it remains the most impressive project as it was my first experience. ""Piano Staircrafting (Android)"" One day was the way to class at school. The stairs were empty, but when I saw a lot of students flocking to the elevator, I thought, ""How can I distribute the students to the stairs?"" and thought, ""It would be nice if I could play the piano sound every time I climbed the stairs."" So, I conducted a team project in a class called Comprehensive Design with the motifs of three things: interest-inducing, exercise, and energy-saving. We detected people's feet through sensors and printed out the right sound for each step as a sound, and produced an Android application that can be operated on a smartphone through Bluetooth communication. Lastly, I remember that it was installed on campus for three days and received a lot of attention from students and professors. I felt a special sense of accomplishment in that I solved the problems of our living spaces. Since you have to work ""loving"" for a long time, you can get tired easily if you don't do it with interest and pride in what you want to do. However, when I imagine my friends playing a game that I developed with my own hands at NHN Entertainment, I think I can work with pride and joy. ""Engineers need to know how to express themselves."" There is one thing I recently felt. I think SW engineers should be able to write what they think and express themselves in words. I will work on that in the future because I think that no matter how good an engineer is, if he or she lacks these skills, he or she cannot become a good engineer. Korea's mobile game market, which is ""convergence,"" has grown rapidly, centering on Kakao games. New mobile games are pouring out every month, but most mobile game forms looked similar. If NHN Entertainment provides a differentiated service than other game companies, I think it can lead the mobile game market further in the future. If wearable devices such as Google Glass and smart watches, which are growing along with mobile games, are combined into games, it will be a differentiated weapon from other companies. NHN Entertainment wants to create a tangible game by utilizing the sensors installed in the smartphone or by linking other hardware."
"I think Dongbu has a more important responsibility than other companies because it provides solutions to financial IT companies where security is the most important. As such, Dongbu applied because I thought that only more important and valuable people could work. With the introduction of virtualization and cloud, I think the need to analyze how much traffic applications generate has become important. Since efficient network operation leads to cost savings and profit improvement, we thought it was necessary to identify and prevent network vulnerabilities that can cause failures, analyze the flow, and appropriately apply QoS according to the purpose to optimize network resource use. When I implemented DNS server using Java language while taking the information and communication system design course, I understood the operating principle of DNS through the team project and was able to check the type of packets using the Wireshark program. During vacation, I also obtained OCP certification by taking the OOOOODB curriculum at Oracle DB and Big Data Expert Course and OOOOO. Once, while I was an intern at an ERP solution developer for a month, I was able to feel the working atmosphere while testing the groupware developed by OOO company domino notes. Recently, I installed the kernel on the Linux operating system using Raspberry Pi in my lab and controlled GPIO. Finally, I linked the temperature and humidity sensor with MySQL and stored it in the database and checked it on the web. With my experience in programming or internship at an ERP solution development company, I want to grow into a great ICT engineer who develops systems in the east. Challenges to learning are always interesting. During vacation, I was able to experience the design process and empathize with the design sensibility while taking a UX design school course. It may be ironic that engineering majors study design, but in the 4th Industrial Revolution, I studied UX design because I thought it would be difficult to create a good solution without going through the UX design process that recognizes humanities value judgment and sensitivity rather than technology. I have the ability to develop core technologies based on engineering I learned while majoring in in information and communication electronics, and the ability to develop efficient applications through convergence research in the HCI and UX fields in graduate schools. Due to the occupancy time of cafe customers, research in various fields was conducted to create unprecedented value, such as subway passenger distribution systems, display smart curating services, and improvement of waiting times for children's hospitals. Even though I was an engineer, I participated in the task of discovering problems by observing them for three days in the hospital. By going to the field, I was able to discover unexpected parts in the desk research process. I have always tried to be the best in the field of ICT convergence, so I have been able to achieve good results so far. I will become a talented person who constantly challenges and contributes to the organization even as an Easterner in the future. I have experience in launching a smart curating service using Bluetooth and beacon in the OOO Museum. Although we were in charge of researching indoor location-based algorithms and initially implemented them using BLE signals, we found a problem with low accuracy due to signal distortion and refraction caused by high ceilings and steel walls. It was a big crisis prior to commercialization, but we constantly visited the site every day to observe facilities and people for better performance and looked for ways. After much consideration, we overcame the crisis by significantly lowering the error rate by implementing an algorithm that fused relatively accurate magnetic field sensors. Through this, we published a number of papers and applied for two patents. I learned that commercialization services are very difficult, unlike simple school projects. The test process also took a considerable amount of time because errors can even lead to customer loss. Through this, I was able to experience the process of the creation of a new service in a company such as Dongbu Group, and I could also sympathize with the fact that there are numerous efforts behind it. In addition, I was able to communicate with the multidisciplinary team and experience the design process, and based on the convergence and collaboration capabilities that designed the entire process from problem recognition to solution, I would like to create new customer value that combines technology and business with colleagues."
"If you look at the intelligent building system of Lotte World 2 or the U-City in Wonju, you can see scenes that you have only seen in science fiction movies applied to your life one by one. I want to join Lotte information and communication, which is moving forward for a ubiquitous world, in making imaginary characters a reality. When I was carrying out a national project at the Korea Institute of Production and Technology, I had a meeting with doctors for two months to develop ways to collaborate in the organization and teamwork skills. I also experienced difficulties indirectly by watching the collaboration process with partner companies in detail through the engineering doctor next to me. I think that the experience of large-scale projects and collaboration between companies can effectively apply the business requirements of Lotte ICT's business to the industry and contribute to the creation of a profit model. ""Fancy going out, I see as much as I know."" After seeing the wide world in the deep sea at 18m, Vauxhall Island, the Philippines, I felt as much as I wanted to. I had a severe phobia about water since I was young, but I tried scuba diving because I didn't want to live avoiding it all my life. I saw thousands of kinds of fish in the sea, and I experienced the beauty of the beautiful deep sea by taking pictures with sea turtles. In the meantime, the sea was a dangerous place for me, but now it has become the most beautiful place. As the saying goes, ""As much as I know and as much as I feel,"" I felt once again that experience becomes an asset and I can see the world in a richer way. The rough journey with my friends was cheated by their poor English skills and at night there was a dangerous situation where they were questioned by the police for unreasonable taxi fares. However, through this journey, I developed a broader perspective and helped me a lot in improving my confidence. ""Parking 6,000 cars in just two months?"" I liked cars since I was young, so I got my driver's license as soon as I turned 19. When I was a freshman in college, I wanted to try different kinds of cars, so I worked part-time at a department store valet parking. The OOO VIP parking team managed an average of 1,800 vehicles a day by just 10 parking staff, and I was running around alone parking more than 100 cars. At first, I was embarrassed because the side brakes and gear transmissions were different for each type and manufacturer, but I had a valuable experience driving from imported vehicles to domestic vehicles to small vehicles to large vehicles. I want to become a new employee of Lotte Information and Communication because I like IT, just like I worked part-time at valet parking because I liked a car. As much as I try my best to be passionate and immersed in what I like and want, Lotte Information and Communication will contribute to generating profits in new businesses through my passion and immersion in IT. On the way to the ""Building a System in the School"" class, I saw many students standing in line in the elevator, and I looked for ways to increase the utilization rate of stairs. I thought that if I could play the piano sound when climbing the stairs, it would increase the use of stairs and reduce the congestion of elevators. I gathered a team at the OOO Society and carried out a project to solve the problem. It detected people's feet through sensors and output a scale suitable for each step through a speaker. Troubleshooting occurred due to electricity during the output process, but the cause was found through a systematic approach and analysis and solved through ground readjustment. Through Bluetooth communication, the company even improved the quality of its projects by providing an application that allows students to operate on their phones. This project helped improve their technical capabilities, and the project was able to be installed at the school for three days to attract the attention of students and professors. Above all, it remains an unforgettable memory that we solved the inconveniences in our lives through this project. ""Presentation Skill"" engineers need to be able to write technology and express it in words. However, most engineers have excellent personal skills, but they lack a lot of presentation skills. This is also my biggest weakness. Assuming that I have a competency of 10, I often get underestimated because I can only say seven. To compensate for this, I am constantly making efforts to improve my team projects, such as giving presentations as representatives. ""Executive leader! Humble junior!"" I will always be active in all projects with the spirit of master that I value. And I believe in the power of the word ""we."" I will be a strong stepping stone between seniors and juniors to create smooth teamwork and synergy by emphasizing ""we"" rather than ""me"" in a team project. For one year after joining the company, I will actively utilize the mentor-mentee system and in-house programs to quickly adapt to the atmosphere of the company. In five years, I will work hard on the business of expanding several overseas businesses on behalf of Lotte Information and Communication in Asia. I will study not only English but also the local language from time to time. In 10 years, along with the many innovative projects I have made, I will be a leader who leads the team by example and a junior who is always humble and willing to learn from the seniors. I will always challenge with passion and become an active and fluid employee who changes rapidly in a rapidly changing era."
"LG CNS's business is the most consistent with the research I have done. It was attractive to think about providing value and to expand into new areas by fusion of technology, and I applied because I was confident that we could grow together. Currently, I am conducting technology-based human-centered research in graduate school. Humanities, design, and engineering majors formed a multidisciplinary team to collaborate on everything from problem recognition to solutions, and conducted research on the fields of HCI, UX, IoT, and AI for two years. When working on a project to reduce waiting times at OOO Hospital, I also experienced the process of discovering problems by observing them for three days at the hospital. By going to the field, I was able to discover unexpected parts in desk research and by experiencing the entire process from the planning stage to the solution stage, I was able to have a wide range of insights. In this way, I am confident that the experiences that the team solved head-to-head will be able to solve future problems together with LG CNS. Language C is the longest learned language because it is used in various fields from application programming to network, system, and graphic programming. At the university level, I am good enough to implement a demo program, and I can say that it is the most confident language. Recently, I installed the kernel on the Linux operating system using Raspberry Pi and controlled GPIO. Finally, I was able to link the temperature and humidity sensor with MySQL and store it in the database and even check it on the web. In addition, I tried to create artificial intelligence Amazon Alexa with Raspberry Pi, microphone, and speaker using open source, and while studying deep learning, I have experience implementing cost function and gradient design function in python language. In January of this year, we launched a smart curating IoT service using beacon in the OOO Museum. As an industry-academia joint project, I participated in a team with one company and planning, design, and majors, and I was able to communicate in a multidisciplinary team, experience the design process, and learn design sensibilities. The main role was the study of indoor location-based algorithms. At first, it was implemented using only BLE beacon, but the accuracy of the wireless signal was low for actual commercialization service. As a result of the test, the service we wanted was not properly performed, and other methods were needed for better performance. After much consideration, we implemented the algorithm by fusing relatively accurate magnetic field sensors, and we were able to solve some of the problems in terms of accuracy. Through this, we published a number of papers and applied for two patents. Unlike the project that was simply developed as a demo at school, it was difficult to commercialize it, so we were able to indirectly experience the process and difficulties that companies such as LG CNS had in developing new services, and I could also sympathize with the fact that numerous people's efforts follow behind it. I want to become a person who creates unprecedented values in smart factories, logistics, and new future industries by focusing on future technology R&D and converging technology with customer business. Core technology is included in products and services, but in the end, people are the ultimate target of technology, so it will be more meaningful and necessary research if you understand and develop the context from the research stage. Based on the engineering capabilities of electronics and communications that I learned at the undergraduate school, I think that the two years of convergence research at the graduate school will be a great strength in in in-depth research and development in the future. In order to become an engineer who understands the trend of the times and actively responds to changes, I read more than one trend book a month and set a quantitative goal of publishing more than two papers or patents a year. As new knowledge and related technologies pour out every day in the IoT and artificial intelligence fields, I want to become a talented person who challenges the discovery, implementation, test, and application of new technologies to keep up with the trend."
"""I will become a network quality management expert."" In the second semester of my second year, I came into direct contact with the field of communication while taking a signal and systems course. The grades, which were not good compared to the interest I felt, made me focus more on the field of communication. I will join KT and become a talented person who grows together with KT. I will work at the front line of network service and become a person who absorbs many things like a sponge. After that, I will try to optimize the quality of the network so that customers can use the best communication services by spewing out a lot of things that I have absorbed. Wherever KT's influence is reached, we will provide communication services that can further highlight the know-how in network management that has been accumulated as much as KT's long history. I will vividly convey the convenience I felt to customers. I will be an engineer who considers customer satisfaction so that customers can always use the best quality and service without any inconvenience. ""Teamwork that begins with consideration and communication."" Last semester, we conducted a long-term group thesis assignment that takes up a large portion of our grades. In the process, I experienced various problems such as irritation, stress, and discord among the group members. There were two major problems in our group. First, the lack of active participation by a small number of members clouded the overall atmosphere, and the hard-participating members became dissatisfied and an opinion was formed to penalize those who did not attend. Second, this atmosphere was formed, so the disagreement between the members of the group deepened while insisting only on each other's arguments without concessions during the exchange of opinions. In this regard, I asked the low-participating members of the group about the reasons for not being able to participate, and suggested that if there was a reason, I give them another role to deal with the situation. The team members with justifiable reasons were given other additional roles, such as summarizing and organizing the assignment, determining the meeting place, etc., so that they could participate in the assignment and understand the progress. As a result, everyone was able to keep pace together. In addition, on days when we had time to spare, we had a conversation while eating together after the group meeting, and exchanged opinions in each other's minds with time to promote friendship. In this way, through conversation and communication with all the members of the group, I was able to finish the thesis in a good mood while receiving good grades. Through this experience, I realized the importance of teamwork among members, and that for teamwork, we must work together through proper communication and conversation. ""I will become a communicative talent."" After being discharged from the military, I worked in a distribution center. At that time, my role was to organize the inventory within the company. While I was working, I was moved to another department by the manager. The department was in charge of rearranging the new items so that the staff ladies could work quickly. There, I came to work in pairs with an employee with a disability. The working ladies said they were having difficulty with their work because of the employee with the disability. Working together, I found that they were having difficulty organizing the items in alphabetical order. I thought about how to handle things efficiently. It wasn't difficult for the general public, but I judged that the employee with the disability received a large amount of goods instantly and was confused. So, I received the items first and assigned them to the employee who was not feeling well. So he was able to handle small tasks one by one, working without getting them wrong. In addition, both I and several employees in the company are now able to handle tasks efficiently. There, I learned how to act as a bridgehead by grasping each other's positions and situations when problems arise, and how to handle tasks efficiently for everyone. Based on this experience, I will efficiently handle tasks through communication within the company. In addition, I will play a role in providing the best service by thinking from the perspective of the customer in the network control/operation job. ""We will provide the best service for everyone."" In the era of Giga Internet, our lives seek fast speed and good quality. While living in a world where days are passing by faster, areas and people who cannot keep up with the speed are emerging. As I have questions about these differences in communication, I think we should be able to communicate with the same speed and quality as in the city center as well as in the outer areas. Based on this experience, I will make sure that the network system can perform as well as in the outer areas as in the central areas. Also, in the event of a failure, we will try to solve the problem quickly and accurately. And as a major, I will thoroughly manage the software part of the system so that there is no problem."
"""The importance of a trust network I felt firsthand"" I wanted to create a trust network with each other. With the knowledge I gained while majoring in computer engineering, I was able to find ways to be helpful to someone and build a trust network. When I was a bachelor's degree, the first thing I wanted to do when I was in the second year was to apply as a mentor for a mentoring program within the department. The reason is that I wanted to help a junior like myself because I had experienced difficulties in setting up a career path when I was in the first year. Working as a mentor for a basic programming subject, I met a total of six juniors once a week. I wanted to convey my major knowledge effectively, so I encouraged voluntary participation by preparing examples appropriate to the level of my mentee juniors, going beyond formal ones. In addition to learning guidance, I saved each and built trust with each other, such as advice as seniors and counseling on school life. As a result, I became interested in conveying to someone in my own way as I saw the juniors who were mentees actively participating with trust in me. In addition, to this day, I was able to feel the importance and reward of creating a new network while maintaining junior relationships and opening up my thoughts with each other's trust. ""The essence of the lecture is the elderly."" Another opportunity to form a trust network was the education service using smartphones for the elderly. As a volunteer member of a telecommunications company, OOOO Welfare Center conducted three hours of training every Friday for four months. I was actively engaged in the program's purpose to reduce the information gap between generations and my goal of learning eye-level communication. As for the training method, eight team members organized the training contents for a week together and held many-to-one lectures on Fridays. However, a fatal problem occurred during the course of this lecture method, and I actively suggested to the team leader that the lecture method be changed to a multi-group lecture. There was a problem that at least one to as many as three people kept skipping classes every week. The main reason was that the content of the lecture was too difficult and one-sided, so it was difficult to follow. Therefore, my suggestion was that one team member would give lectures to three to four senior citizens to increase the efficiency of the lecture. There were already some team members who were burdened with giving up on high-quality manuals and traditional methods. However, the elderly actively persuaded us that they trusted us and wanted to learn one thing, and as a result, the group lecture began in the fourth week. The team members felt a sense of responsibility, and the elderly only focused on what was needed, and the quality of the lecture naturally improved. In addition, I felt sorry for the seniors who were absent, so I called them one by one again to talk about the new teaching method, and finally, I was able to achieve a valuable relationship by conducting the lecture with a total of 27 minutes for about three months. One of the seniors I worked for still sends me a text with questions from time to time. Whenever I receive a text message, I feel proud that they still trust me and that an important trust network has been formed. It made me realize that mutual trust networks are important once again beyond formal networks based on each other's needs. Not only through two experiences, but also through multiple situations, I felt the importance of a trust network in which I trust the other person and the other person trusts me. Midas IT also wants to build a trust network in the second act of life through communication without walls up, down, left and right. ""Trust 30, responsibility 30, technical understanding 30, and I will fill the remaining 10 points."" The most important practical competencies in the web solution technology support job are trust, responsibility, and technical understanding. Through specific questions at the job information session held at my alma mater, I learned that the job that best suits my aptitude and competency is web solution technology support. ""Trust 30: I will make trust in products and companies from myself."" What I wanted to achieve the most in my life was to form a trust network. Above all, if the other person trusts me, the core of network formation was to repay the trust that I also responded to. In addition to a department mentoring program and a smartphone-based education for the elderly, I also had experience in IT education services in Indonesia three years ago. As a member of OOOOOOOO, I taught programming language C and video editing programs in Lampung, Indonesia to local university students. Most of the local students had difficulties, but with trust in my lectures, they asked me questions about things they didn't know even after class and participated in the last class. In order to repay the trust along with the class, I thought of making lecture materials so that my team can review them even after returning home. The textbook that I started producing in the third week has been over 80 pages since the end of the lecture, and I was able to get feedback from local students thanking them for making a textbook that I can review. In order to build trust in Midas IT and its products, I think we need to build the customer's trust in me first. I am ready to draw the customer's trust by having a sincere attitude toward the other person and forming a network that does not want compensation. ""Responsibility 30: I learned from the conviction of being with the customer until the end without falling behind."" While drawing out the customer's trust, the appropriate responsibility is also an essential competency of the technical support job. I have developed a sense of responsibility through the conviction that all of my team members should be together in team projects. Two years ago, I had the experience of making some sacrifices to help my team members while working on a development project. Among the four randomly assigned teams was a Chinese friend who was an exchange student. In the process of sharing roles, the friend was embarrassed by the lack of knowledge of Java that will be used in the project. The team members implicitly suggested that only participation be significant, but as the team leader, I objected. We came together to gain practical project experience, and we wanted to feel a sense of accomplishment by actively participating.As a result, I took the time to teach my Chinese friend Java using my past C language mentoring experiences when we gathered twice a week for the development process. Although my development part was a little slower, my Chinese friend followed me well, making the project progress much easier, and I was able to hear my Chinese friend's proud feedback saying thank you for learning a lot. Recently, the needs of customers are becoming more diverse and subdivided. Customers who trusted Midas IT's products thought about the future, constantly compared and reviewed other products, and finally purchased them. Therefore, I thought it was essential to have a responsibility to support each customer's detailed needs in a cooperative manner, provide appropriate user training if necessary, and stay with them until the end. ""Technical Understanding 30: I will cope with it with sponge-like absorption."" Finally, I thought that appropriate technical support and user training were possible only when a complete technical understanding of the product and solution was based. A complete understanding requires absorption that can be sucked in like a sponge without fear of new things. As a graduation project, it was necessary to learn about Raspberry Pi and Arduino, which are ultra-small PCs, while developing the 'IoT-based Facility Failure Prediction System'. In addition, for communication with the server, I had to learn a new language, Python, not the Java language I was previously confident in. As it was a year-long graduation project, it was a very busy time with various procedures such as analyzing requirements, designing, and testing in addition to development, but I tried to find a breakthrough effectively. Two team members, including me, were in a similar situation, so I suggested a study in which we presented and discussed what we had been studying twice a week during the vacation. With the consent of the team members, we were able to continue the study for about 3 months, add teamwork, and consequently advance the development time more than planned. This is a valuable experience that we have come up with effective methods to understand new contents and have produced results through teamwork. There should be no resistance to new technologies as various solutions and products come out and require a lot of technical support. I am also interested in IT trends and various new technologies, so I always look for them and organize my thoughts by scraping the parts that I think are important. After joining the company, I will be the first to completely understand Midas IT's various products and solutions. ""The remaining 10: I will always find and fill in the shortcomings."" Although I have consistently had the ability to trust, responsibility, and understand the product line, I think the remaining 10 points are scores that I can fill by experiencing actual practice after joining the company. When solving a problem, 'using past experiences well' is my strength. In my internship life, I studied data compression algorithms using algorithms I learned in past projects, and tried to solve conflicts arising from team projects in various ways. I will perform technical support work based on my strengths at Midas IT, and I will have an active attitude to utilize the competencies I have gained in the past. In addition, I will flexibly cope with various situations arising from the relationship between the customer and the team members based on trust and effective coping methods in the past."
"By collaborating on the ""Donghwa Group's co-worker"" and ""Improving the in-school course registration system"" project, we obtained the results of the 7th place in the interim evaluation and the 2nd place in the final evaluation. Through this, I learned the power of collaboration and grew into a person who practices collaboration. The final goal of the project was to express the functions delivered by the improved system in UML such as use cases, ERD, DFD, and sequence diagrams. To make matters worse, there was a team member who was left behind in a situation where a small number of people had to bear a large amount of work because the team member who was in charge of PM was excluded on the way due to early employment. As I was a double major student, I was a team member who lacked basic knowledge of UML. I delivered the materials I referred to when I took the programming course, gave questions and answers at times through messenger, and helped my team members understand. At first, it was somewhat difficult to understand unfamiliar concepts such as objects and attributes, but as a result of steadily helping me learn, my team members' skills have improved significantly enough to write DFD on my own. My task alone was very overwhelming and I felt a lot of time pressure. However, when I first learned UML, I tried to understand the position of the team members by recalling the old me, who was difficult, and I tried my best to reflect on the fact that it was a common goal, not just a single goal. As a result, everyone was able to actively participate without a single person falling behind, resulting in high-quality results. Collaboration not only means that everyone works together to cooperate, but I think it also means that if there are colleagues who are struggling, they are willing to self-proclaim and share and lead the difficulties. If I had not led a team member who was lagging behind, not only would the final result of the project have not been produced within the period, but I think the meaning of the team project would have also changed. I will become a co-worker of the Donghwa Group, which creates team results by demonstrating my main weapon, collaboration ability, which is my main weapon in the IT industry, where collaboration is dominated. ""The concept of thorough time."" My new life is 'Let's keep time promises'. Reflecting on my mother's advice to not even be friends with people who don't keep time promises, I also tried to become a thorough person in time promises, and I am still trying. For example, while working part-time at an academy for a year, I prepared classes by arriving 20 minutes in advance each time. I was the first teacher who has worked so far who has never been late, and I received a proposal from the director. This thorough concept of time has made me reborn as a sincere person. I will be a sincere new employee who is not always late even after joining the fairy tale group and does my part. ""What's the good thing that makes you smile so much?"" My personality strength is bright energy. In preparation for the contest, I raised the spirits of my team members with my bright energy. When I first prepared for the contest, it took a long time due to the topic selection. In the end, I had to stay up all night every other day from the point a week before the submission period. I prepared a surprise snack for my team members who were tired of a series of overnight meetings, and I ate snacks and talked with them, using my rechargeable energy to finish the contest safely within the period. At that time, the team members nicknamed me 'OOO', saying, ""What good thing happened that made you smile so much that you meet?"" Even if I become a member of the fairy tale group, I will always be a room that never loses my laughter in any bad work. The disadvantage of my personality is that I have a strong desire to win. I often get excessive stress when I fail to fulfill my desired goal. After finishing second out of the six teams unfortunately in the sports competition I participated in when I was a freshman, I had an experience that hindered my studies as I couldn't get my hands on things all day long. To overcome my shortcomings, I am trying to look at the situation with positive thinking and confidence that another good thing will come soon even if I experience successive failures. I will be reborn as a challenging person who does not fear failure by fusion of restrained desire for victory and positive thinking. I will be a person in the Donghwa Group who challenges with the confidence that I can do it. 1) Why you want to do an application job, 2) why you have to be this company, 3) How the accumulated competencies can be used in the application work can be used in the process ""Building Happiness with Donghwa Group"" I realize that IT is indispensable in the industry as IT convergence, an convergence between IT and other industries, is actively taking place. I majored in industrial engineering and was fascinated by IT that supports the smooth operation of the industry, and I applied to create a convenient world with IT with Donghwa Group. Donghwa Group, which is expanding into the world by carrying out businesses closely related to life such as materials, auto life, and media, has the most suitable environment to realize my vision to contribute to the happiness of everyone, young and old. I believe that I will be able to enjoy my work as if I were playing in a Donghwa Group, which seeks happiness based on the EVP, an employee value proposition. Together with these Donghwa groups, I will create a convenient world with IT. I have developed two competencies to be reborn as suitable talents for the Donghwa Group's IT job. ""First, competencies required to perform tasks."" In addition to development skills, IT managers must also have an understanding of the industry. During my undergraduate years, I developed the ability to sharply grasp the characteristics of the industry by working on various projects that combine IT and industry, such as ""Smart Factory Design using Cloud Computing"" and ""Improving Inventory Management System for Clothing Stores."" I decided that the foundation of IT is data, and I majored in multiple statistics to learn in-depth about data processing and analysis. In the process of learning statistical programming such as SAS or R, I developed numerical analysis skills. After completing the undergraduate program, I took an application SW engineer training course at the OOOO Institute and learned several IT knowledge, including Java, HTML5, JSP, JQuery, JavaScript, Oracle, Spring Framework, and MyBatis.By using the learned knowledge, I have acquired practical skills by conducting development projects such as Free Video Lecture Sites and Used Auction Sites. ""Second, Competencies Required for Work Life."" After working as an intern at OOO for 6 months, I learned the basics of work life that are trivial but should never be overlooked. For example, when I was handed a task, I realized that it was more important to immediately ask and get the instructions correctly and give the right result rather than reversing the task by trying to solve the problem by myself. I will use all these capabilities to develop happiness with Donghwa Group. There are two things I want to do in Donghwa Group. ""First, Developing an Intuitive System for the Middle and Elderly."" Looking at my parents who are not familiar with using mobile apps and homepages, I thought that I would like to develop a more intuitive and convenient system for the elderly. I would like to develop and operate a button location on OOO Auction, where used car auctions are held online, and on OOO, an online portal that provides used car market prices, with the user's convenience. ""Second, Development of Real-Time Inventory Management System"" Inventory management will be of paramount importance in the materials business, which is one of the main businesses of Donghwa Group. By developing a system that instantly updates fluctuating inventory information, I want to deliver convenience to employees of Donghwa Group and improve its management efficiency. In doing so, it is my ultimate goal to deliver convenience and pleasure to everyone who is with Donghwa Group. I will make an attractive and interesting Donghwa Group that I want to visit often from the standpoint of customers who are ""leading the used car market."" I will contribute to building an integrated platform environment to convey the feeling of using a used car store anytime, anywhere by applying the omnichannel service. In this way, I will lead the used car market with Donghwa Group. In order to achieve my goal, I will take the next steps. After joining the company, I will focus on learning the work process by going to work 30 minutes early every day. After five years of joining the company, I will constantly learn new IT technologies so as not to be eliminated from the rapidly changing IT environment. In addition, I will continue to study foreign languages to increase my competitiveness in the global era. I will be a 'Donghwa-in' who constantly looks at Donghwa Group from the customer's point of view and strives to minimize the inconvenience customers feel. Ten years after joining the company, I will become a global IT expert who can be the cornerstone of Donghwa Group's growth as a leader in the global wood industry and a leading brand in the automobile distribution industry of Korea. ""Working well, and Who I want to work with"" I took an application software engineer and DB engineer training course at the OOOO Institute of Education, and for about five weeks, I worked on the ""Development of Used Auction Sites"" project for nearly 10 hours a day with the goal of ""absorbing 100% of what I have learned through the project."" The goal of the project was to develop a used auction site where safe transactions are guaranteed by supplementing the limitations of used sites where there is anxiety among buyers caused by unsafe transactions. I was in charge of linking membership DB such as membership registration, login, information modification, and withdrawal. While implementing the membership registration function, I wanted to add a profile picture registration and preview function for transparent transactions, which is the main focus of used auction sites, and to challenge functions I have not encountered. To this end, I studied data processing in the form of Multipart through efforts such as Googling and asking for advice from the instructor. Due to complex source codes and errors occurring everywhere, morale has also been lowered. However, looking back on my goal, I immediately asked questions that I did not know enough to jokingly hear 'pay for extra tutoring to the teacher', and I tried to make the acquired one's own. Even after class, I conducted separate personal learning through a book called Toby's Spring and learned in an active attitude. As a result, compared to the previous 'I', the breadth of knowledge has improved significantly, and I have confidence that I can do anything. In addition, I was honored to win first place among eight teams in the project presentation. In this way, I have a spirit of challenge to learn new knowledge and develop existing knowledge. Now, I will show you all of these in the fairy tale group. I will always learn from you in a humble manner and show you how hard I work on my own. In this way, I will become a new employee of Donghwa Group who is good at work and wants to work with you."
"""Exercise commitment to a common goal"" A dedicated person in my opinion is a person who does his or her best to achieve a common goal even at the expense of his or her own loss or sacrifice. For example, I have grown into a person who practices dedication by carrying out a project to improve the course application system. Due to early employment, a team member who was in charge of PM was excluded, so the project had to be carried out with a small number of 3 people. To make matters worse, there was a team member who was a little behind in a situation where a small number of people had to share a large amount of work. As the team member delayed the schedule little by little, complaints poured out from all over the place. As a student majoring in industrial engineering, I decided that I lacked basic knowledge of diagrams and helped my team members understand by taking the time to explain the basic concepts such as objects and attributes step by step. At first, it was a bit difficult to understand an unfamiliar concept, but it quickly followed and finally reached the level of writing DFD on its own. I felt a lot of pressure to take charge of multiple tasks at the same time, but every time I did, I tried my best to remind myself that it was not my own goal, but a common goal. As a result, we were able to complete the project safely within a given period by actively participating without a single dropout. I will be the top contributor to Hanwha S&C, which is devoted to the team, no matter what difficulties we face in the IT industry, which is mainly collaborating. I challenged various IT experiences in order to be reborn as a talented person suitable for Hanwha S&C's application operation job. First, while working as an intern at a research company, I was in charge of managing the survey DB. Through JDBC, we implemented the function to inquire, add, modify, and delete the survey DB collected by linking Java and Oracle. In the process of understanding the data flow inside the server, we increased our understanding of the system. Second, while taking an application SW engineer training course at the OOOO Training Institute, we carried out a project to build a server similar to the corporate web using HTML5, CSS, JS/servelet, and jQuery. Focusing on maximizing user convenience and ease of maintenance, we proceeded with the project and developed practical skills. In addition, while dealing with Java, we gained knowledge necessary for application operation jobs such as algorithms and data structure. Third, during my undergraduate years, I engaged in various projects that combined IT and industry, such as ""Smart Factory Design Using Cloud Computing"" and ""Clothing Store Inventory Management System Design,"" and developed communication skills as well as the ability to clearly grasp the characteristics of the industry that customers are engaged in. I can't say that my job competency is superior to anyone yet. However, I am ready to grow with Hanwha S&C based on the IT experience I have challenged so far. ""I have too much desire to win."" When implementing a goal, I tend to be unable to look around with motivation, and when I fail to fulfill my desired goal, I get too much stress. I don't think I've overcome it easily because I'm the second of three sisters and was formed as a result of competition in good faith. In order to overcome my shortcomings, I'm trying to see the situation with positive thinking and confidence that another good thing will come soon, even if I taste a series of failures. I will be reborn as a challenging person who does not fear failure by fusion of restrained competitive spirit and positive thinking. I will become a talented person of Hanwha S&C who challenges with the confidence that I can do it. ""Speed fast."" I tend to speak faster when I am nervous or excited. I often hear a joke that you rap because you speak fast. I tried to speak slowly, but I couldn't overcome the desire to deliver the story quickly. Recently, I received a feedback that if I slow down my speech a little while conducting a job study, I will be able to impress interviewers better. Before I say anything, I am trying to organize it in my head again and then talk calmly. I will be the medium of communication between Hanwha S&C, which communicates with accurate pronunciation and calm accent. ""Central Inventory Management System"" In the rapidly changing IT environment, if there is no SMART insight and differentiated CREATIVE that looks into the far future, you will fall behind. In order to deliver a true impression to customers by competing with various existing IT services, I think SMART&CREATIVE must be added to the service. In the project under the theme of ""Designing the Clothing Store Inventory Management System"", we proposed the introduction of a central inventory management system to achieve maximum customer satisfaction. We found the inconvenience of the existing system that could not check the inventory of offline stores online. If we receive inventory information in real time, the customer's convenience will be greatly improved, but we decided that it is not difficult for companies because it is difficult to link order information DB and inventory DB in real time. In order to improve the efficiency of both customers and companies, we proposed the introduction of a central inventory management system that immediately processes order information DB and inventory DB. There were numerous trials and errors before we came up with the introduction of a central inventory management system. However, I don't think the process was a waste of time. I was able to find myself more SMART by devising a CREATIVE plan for system users. Even after joining Hanwha S&C, I will become the leading person who practices SMART&CREATIVE, Hanwha S&C's vision slogan, SMART&CREATIVE. ""Leader of the Fourth Industrial Revolution"" Amid the rise of the 4th Industrial Revolution, where intelligence is achieved by IT, Hanwha S&C is rapidly absorbing IoT technology that leads the 4th Industrial Revolution, such as sensing and service interfaces. This is a great advantage of Hanwha S&C, and it is expected to grow into a leader in the fourth industrial revolution soon by creating insights and synergies of Hanwha S&C, which provides timely IT services according to the trend of the times.The media industry is a field that can be easily accessed by anyone of all ages and can communicate directly with customers. It is true that Hanwha S&C is not recognized significantly because it does not hold the lead in this field. However, we are focusing on discovering new businesses such as global fintech and data business, so we will be able to overcome our shortcomings easily. ""Securing Competitiveness in Major Businesses"" In order for Hanwha S&C to grow into a Global ICT Leader in the future, securing competitiveness in Hanwha S&C's main business should be given priority. In the case of the smart factory, which is Hanwha S&C's main business, it is the most active field right now by acquiring SIT's factory automation technology in 2016, but there are not many places where the smart factory process has yet entered. If we supplement this and apply the new business model to various industries, we are confident that it will not be long before it grows into a Global ICT Leader."
"""Skin Food Supporters Increase Event Participants by 200%"" Working as a Skin Food Supporter, I challenged to increase the number of participants in a new product promotion event by 200% and have achieved this. The new product promotion event was the activity that reflected the team score the most, so I set a goal of increasing the number of participants by 200%. The team members, like me, were greedy to win first place, so I had no doubt that they would achieve their goal if everyone worked together. Skin Food Supporters have been holding events at universities where they have been invited. However, most universities that tried to recruit refused because the scheduled event date and the exam period of college students overlapped. I was at a loss because the event date could not be changed, but I didn't give up and came up with a new way to reflect on my goals. After the meeting, I decided to hold the event in a downtown area rather than in a university. There were many things to prepare for due to a sudden change of venue, so I focused on planning by increasing the weekly meeting to two or three times. As a result of sharing roles such as recruiting places, designing, and purchasing goods, the event held in Myeong-dong under the concept of ""Hammer Game with Thor"" in parody of the then-popular movie Avengers ended with a response of more than 250 people. Due to the challenge toward the goal, persistence that did not give up, and collaboration with the team members, we were able to easily overcome unexpected difficulties and achieve an increase of 200%. Even after joining the company, I will become an SK C&C person who creates team results by demonstrating challenges, persistence, and collaboration acquired through this experience. In a project under the theme of ""Creative Central Inventory Management System"" and ""Improvement of Clothing Store Inventory Management System"", we proposed a ""Central Inventory Management System"" that benchmarked the McDelivery service with a unique idea and improved the problems of the existing system. When using the online clothing store, there was an inconvenience of having to contact the store directly to check the inventory. I felt the need for a system that could check the changing inventory situation in real time from the customer's point of view. As a solution to this, we proposed a 'central inventory management system' that benchmarks the McDelivery service, which is a method of delivering order information received centrally by store. To differentiate it from the McDelivery service, we added a function to recommend stores close to the customer's location based on GPS location-based services. As a result, it was well received by the professor in charge as a system that satisfies the needs of customers and efficiency of corporate operation, and it ranked first in the creativity and convenience category among the eight teams. There were numerous trials and errors in applying the McDelivery service to the inventory management system because the service items were different. However, we worked hard to design a differentiated system by meticulously writing UMLs such as physical and logical designs, service blueprints, and use cases. Various IT technologies and products have already appeared, so unless they are creative, they will not be able to easily capture the hearts of customers. For this reason, I think creativity is an essential element for developing technologies that keep up with the rapidly changing IT era. We are ready to support SK C&C with IT services based on creative thinking. ② The ERP mechanism, which I learned by majoring in industrial engineering, can be applied to the development and operation of smart factory systems, and I applied for the IT knowledge acquired in the 'Application SW Engineer Training' to the judgment that it will be best used in the development and operation of web and mobile-based platforms. I will personally prove that SK C&C has no regrets about choosing me because I have the core competencies required to carry out application development tasks, such as understanding and development capabilities of the industry, and sensible work skills. 1. Understanding the Industry: To clearly reflect the customer's requirements in the application, you need to have an understanding of the industry that the customer is engaged in. When I was an undergraduate, I worked on a number of projects that combined IT and industry, such as 'How to build a smart factory using cloud computing' and 'Improving the inventory management system of clothing stores', and developed the ability to grasp the customer's industry sharply. 2. Development Competency: It is the development competency of the IT manager that enables efficient support through the application. I learned IT knowledge such as Java, JSP, JQuery, Oracle, MyBatis, and Spring Framework in the 'Application SW Engineer Training' and based on this, I developed my development capabilities by conducting 'Free Video Lecture Site' and 'Secondhand Auction Site' development projects. In addition, I acquired a SQLD certificate to develop an application that considers not only the accuracy of data but also the usability, and developed my SQL writing ability. 3. Sensible Work: After working as an intern at OOO for 6 months, I acquired sensuous work skills. For example, when I received a task, rather than trying to reverse the task by myself if there was a blockage, I immediately learned exactly what I was asked and instructed, and produced a quick and correct result. As a result, I was praised as a skimpy intern by the assistant manager. ""SK C&C's co-worker's in improving the in-school enrollment system"" project, and through collaboration, I achieved results ranging from 7th place in interim evaluation to 2nd place in final evaluation. Through this experience, I felt the power of cooperation to make what seems impossible possible. To make matters worse, there was a team member who was left behind when the team member who was in charge of PM for early employment was neglected along the way. He was a team member who lacked basic knowledge of UML because he was a double major student. Since a small number of people had to share a large amount of work, I decided that I would not be able to produce results within the period if I overlooked the team member, so I delivered reference materials, helped with Q&A, and filled in the shortcomings of the team member.At first, it was a little difficult to learn unfamiliar concepts such as objects and attributes, but as a result of consistently helping me learn, I made the DFD I set as a goal. It was such a burden of time that I had to stay up all night every other day from a week before the final evaluation. I prepared surprise snacks for my team members who were tired of a series of overnight meetings, encouraged the team members, and I tried my best to remind them that it was a common goal, not just my own. As a result, I was able to attract everyone's participation without falling behind. I learned from this experience that collaboration not only means that everyone works together to cooperate, but also that if there are colleagues who are in trouble, they are willing to self-proclaim and share and lead difficulties together. I will become a co-worker of SK C&C that creates team results by demonstrating my main weapon of collaboration, which is my cooperation in the IT industry."
"""The fundamentals of all medicines are people, and the fundamentals of pharmaceuticals are IT."" I will work with Ildong Pharmaceutical, a top-notch company that contributes to human health and a happy life. I believe IT is the source of Ildong Pharmaceutical, which was launched in 1941 under the motto of 'The fundamentals of all medicines are people.' I believe that Ildong Pharmaceutical has been able to vigorously advance into the new 100 years of its founding history. With the program I developed, I will find it in Ildong Pharmaceutical, a professional reward that promotes the convenience of users and improves the management efficiency of a company. It has the ability to make people's lives more convenient by adding a 'reverse branch' mind to the technology gained from various project experiences ""from the perspective of users, not from the perspective of station branch or developers."" In the project titled 'Improvement of the Inventory Management System for Clothing Stores', we found the inconvenience of having to contact the store directly to check the inventory when using online clothing stores, and proposed a central inventory management system, which is a method of delivering order information received from the central government collectively by store, as an improvement measure. As a result, there was a lot of admiration among the students about how they could come up with this idea. With the mind of 'reverse branch', we will develop a program that minimizes the inconvenience that users feel and satisfies the needs. ""Collaboration, My Own Growth Key Point"" The biggest achievement so far was the experience of obtaining the second place in the final evaluation in the 'Improvement of the in-school course registration system' project. It is the most accomplished experience in that it has achieved great growth from the 7th place in the interim evaluation to the 2nd place in the final evaluation. The growth key point was collaboration. There was a team member who was in charge of PM for early employment, and to make matters worse, I was left behind in a situation where I was neglected. Since they were multiple majors, they lacked basic knowledge of UML. Judging that the final result would not be produced within the period if the team members were overlooked, I delivered reference materials, helped with Q&A, and filled in the shortcomings of the team members. I felt a lot of time pressure as I had to have repeated overnight meetings from a week before the final evaluation. However, when I first learned UML, I tried to understand the situation of the team members by recalling the old me, which was difficult, and I tried my best to recall that it was a common goal. As a result, I was able to attract everyone's participation without falling behind. ""Ildong Pharmaceutical's Converged Talent"" They are convergent talents who have both development and communication skills, which are the core competencies required to carry out information strategy tasks. ""What if they develop? By far, it's me!"" In the application SW engineer training training, we developed development capabilities by carrying out development projects such as ""Free Video Lecture Sites"" and ""Secondhand Auction Sites"" based on JSP, Oracle, JQuery, HTML5, and Spring Framework. It has developed technology by implementing mobile phone authentication using Open API and Quartz technology for processing Garbage data. In addition, in order to develop a site that considers not only the accuracy of data but also the usability, we have developed our SQL writing skills by obtaining SQLD certificate. We will demonstrate our development capabilities to help stabilize and hinder the program and improve it to more advanced programs. ""A good listener, good talker"" Through my internship experience in the role of middleman between the team leader and the interviewer, I have grown into a good listener and good talker. Through smooth communication, I will break down the barriers to dialogue due to diversification of knowledge background and terminology inconsistency."
"When I was in high school, I was hacked several times and became interested in security experts, so I went to a related department. The department class was a process of acquiring basic knowledge about security in various fields, and the direct work content was divided into five categories: planning, system operation, inspection, response to infringement, and personal information protection through the subject of security career exploration. I usually have a lot of worries about small things, so I am a person who makes a preliminary plan and proceeds with it, and I applied because I thought that my strong point of being responsible and meticulous in checking the safety of the system fits well. For this job, I have maintained high grades by focusing on department classes to acquire basic computer and security knowledge. I also obtained an information processing industry driver certificate by organizing what I learned, and I am currently preparing an information security industry driver certificate. In addition, in order to experience actual security work, I conducted an internship for two months in the infringement accident analysis team as a field practice. During the internship period, I acquired information related to vulnerabilities by acquiring security trends and writing manuals to be used in the company's products, and based on this, I also simulated buffer overflow in vulnerable applications and wrote an analysis report. Through my short internship, I was able to communicate with various people and experience analysis work indirectly. Since I was very young, I was passive and shy, making it difficult to hang out with my relatives, let alone friends. I spent most of my time with computers because my parents worked together and I didn't have many friends in elementary school. At that time, I was jokingly teased by male students for being a little chubby, and when I was sensitive to the behavior of others, I became more depressed. When I entered middle school, I was unable to make any friends and spent a year in seclusion, and I decided to improve my personality through this. I tried to think positively by making a bright expression in front of a mirror to overcome my self-esteem, and it was difficult to make eye contact when talking to others, but I tried to get used to it. In the new semester, I first approached and talked to a friend sitting alone, and I sympathized with what she liked. Through these efforts, I was able to find out that there are people who like me, and I was able to overcome my avoidance of interpersonal relationships. While living in college, I decided to lose weight for the first time. I started thinking that I would never be able to do it again if I were not this young, and I set my goal not for a short-term reduction but a long-term war, suppressed my appetite for 5 months, and steadily conducted home training without missing a day. During this period, I lived in school and went to an academy to improve my TOEIC scores during vacation. The moment I felt free and gave up even for a day, I was able to achieve my goal by minimizing the promise. It is easy but clear that it is a difficult task to make a plan that I should do every day and try not to give up. After that, I remembered the pride and sense of accomplishment at the time, I planned to acquire a certificate and experience as an intern, and I want to become a self-developing talent in the future. In a class called Big Data Application Security, I worked on a project to model the IP traceback technique. The project was divided into four areas: Python, Hadoop, R, and Arena, and I played a role in analyzing the correlation between the ip header fields using R. The team was formed through random drawing, but compared to other teams, the atmosphere at the beginning of our team was not passionate and individualistic play was strong. During the team meeting, there was no initiative to suggest the direction of progress or report the detailed progress of the role, and no answer was obtained when asked about or opinion on the group chat room. At first, I planned to follow the lead if there was a friend, but I was embarrassed by the passive atmosphere. After I completed my role to induce active participation of the team members, I organized the IP traceback technique, informed the team members, executed the initial Arena sample model formed by another team member to inform them of the wrong point, and advised them to read the materials to be presented by other team members in advance and to correct them. As a result, the team members began to exchange opinions on the final results one by one, and shared roles to share. As a result, I was able to get good grades in the team project and received compliments indirectly from other team members. At first, I was worried that the project result would be a disgrace compared to other groups, so I was worried about my performance, so I was the first to lead the team and play the role of a mood maker in a project I spent time on, and it was an experience where I felt proud through the changing team atmosphere and progress."
"When I was young, I had the experience of not making friends because of my timid personality. In order to improve my personality, I tried to approach people with a smile and love myself more, and I was able to get positive reviews from others. In addition, I have a habit of making plans and achieving them steadily from my experiences such as dieting, obtaining a certificate, and improving my language score after coming to university. A job is to engage in economic activities and realize oneself. If you have a talent for what you like and can get the goods you need to live, you have to choose without hesitation. In order to become a security expert who was interested in high school, I went on to the Department of Security, and as I studied my major, I became more interested in it and chose it. I thought, 'If there is any information you want to keep the most, what is it?' Many people do, but I think it is financial information. After the large-scale security accident in the financial sector that occurred recently, I became more aware of its importance. KB Kookmin Bank applied because it thought it had a strength in the information security sector in that it was the first in the financial sector to hire white hackers. I thought it was important to first build basic knowledge to enter the information security department, so I focused on studying my major during the semester. Based on this, I obtained the information processing technician license, and I am currently preparing for the information security industry technician license. In addition, I spent two months as an intern at a security company to experience work indirectly and gain social experience. Through the internship experience, I was able to understand security trends and have the opportunity to study various vulnerabilities. I had a free Europe trip by myself for about a month. It was not a 100% prepared trip to make travel plans in parallel with my department class. I was worried about acting rudely because I was not familiar with the culture of the country I went to for the first time, and I had many problems in transportation, language, and budget. I was depressed with worry and fear right before departure, but when I arrived, I was amazed and excited with anticipation. Also, seeing relaxed foreigners made me think, 'What should I do to live without such stress?' As a result, I thought, 'I shouldn't worry too much'. Usually, I started to worry about trivial issues or personal history easily, so I was afraid to challenge new things and lived like a frog in a well. I think this experience gave me the courage to fight back without being afraid of the future. Therefore, I would like to recommend to my acquaintances who are usually timid or scared to go on a trip alone. Recently, AI banking has stepped into the financial market. Now, AI distinguishes owners and provides existing mobile banking services through voice recognition. In response to this, I think we need the ability to provide differentiated competitiveness by understanding and applying new technologies emerging from the Fourth Industrial Revolution in the future. New technology fields that emerged from the Fourth Industrial Revolution include big data, AI, and IoT. While taking a Big Data Application Security course, I have experience in big data analysis using Hadoop and R to extract the desired information, and I have devised a technique to track the spoofed ip and produced a simulation. Also, I think we will be able to devise a way to safely introduce new technologies in terms of security compared to others by watching the daily security and security news every day."
"Shinhan Data System is a company that can confidently shout ""YES"" to the question, ""A company that co-exists together with Shinhan Data System?"" Since its establishment in 1991, I have been moved to see SMART including Mobile, information protection, and more recently, Shinhan Data System that expresses the will to co-exist with customers through strengthening ICT R&D capabilities. As Director Lee Dong-joo said at the SDx Technology Research Agreement Ceremony, ""We expect Shinhan Data System to further solidify its position as a leader in the digital age,"" we were able to gauge the future of Shinhan Data System, which will not yield to any future 'customer impressions'. Along with Shinhan Data System, a warm ICT company that shares the future, it will be a strong support for the dreams and future of customers. ""Shinhan Data System that gives happiness and is loved by all men and women of all ages"" We will create a Shinhan Data System that is happy and loved by all customers. Parents who have difficulty in issuing public certificates visit the bank in person or ask me for help despite the fact that there is a simple and fast application when making financial transactions. If IT services including intuitive functions such as voice recognition and bio-authentication are developed, I think we can expect to secure middle-aged and elderly customers who are not familiar with using non-face-to-face channels as well as to enhance the image of Shinhan Data System. In order to implement the envisioned function directly, trust with service users and expertise in IT service development are required. I learned this while in charge of developing online survey UI in Korea Research. I tried to build trust by putting consideration for the user in the size, color, and location of the button by reviving the experience that all the posts that were written by clicking the wrong button were lost. In addition, I gained expertise by learning various IT knowledge such as MyBatis, JQuery, and JSP. I will work with Shinhan Data System to develop the service I envisioned as a reliable and professional employee. ""I am a convergent talent"" I am a convergent talent with information system knowledge and development capabilities, which are the core competencies required to perform financial IT development tasks. When I was an undergraduate, I took computer science courses such as information system analysis design and industrial system programming, and learned methodologies such as object orientation and CBD. We have developed the ability to understand the flow of data by expressing systems that reflect requirements in projects such as 'improving the in-school course registration system' and 'improving the inventory management system of clothing stores' in modeling languages such as use case, ERD, and DFD. We will exert this knowledge to clearly reflect the needs of users in the system. In the training for training applied SW engineers, we developed a 'free video lecture site' and a 'used auction site' project based on the Spring Framework. We developed development capabilities by implementing SMTP-based email authentication and Quartz technology for processing Garbage data. In addition, we acquired SQLD certification and developed our SQL writing ability. We will develop the financial IT of the Shinhan Data System that is easy and easy to expand functions by demonstrating our development capabilities. As an interim project to train SW engineers applying ""Communication, DNA in my blood vessels"", we developed the importance of communication by conducting 'development of free video lecture sites'. Since it was the first project, everyone was already motivated. The team member who was in charge of developing the bulletin board wanted to add a comment function, and I, who was in charge of linking the member DB, wanted to implement a profile picture preview function. However, it was difficult to implement all the desired functions within a short period of a month. As a result, communication was insufficient because each person was only immersed in their duties, and as a result, the DB and class modifications were not properly communicated, errors occurred in the process of integrating the code. To resolve the error, I worked on the project even after class. Although there was only a week until the deadline, I realized the importance of communication, so I immediately delivered, converged, and shortened the time when there was a fix. As a result, the project was completed safely within the period of time, and we were able to demonstrate a site that contained all the functions we wanted. Communication is DNA in the IT industry, where collaboration is dominated, and the deadline, completeness, and the Shinhan Data System's communication medium will capture two rabbits. ""Fruit 'creative' with the root of 'teamwork'."" When I was working as an OOOO supporter, I tried a creative challenge to change the venue of the new product promotion event to a downtown area and achieved a 200% increase in participants based on teamwork. OOOO supporters have been holding new product promotion events at selected universities. The target of the existing event was a university student. Judging that there are many restrictions on holding an event at a university and the main purchasing group is not limited to university students, I suggested moving the venue to a downtown area and expanding our target. This groundbreaking idea was accepted, and we parodied the hit movie Avengers and held an event in Myeong-dong with the concept of 'Hammer Game with Thor'. The event, which was planned with the team members from one to ten, ended with a great response from about 250 people. The foundation of the creative challenge that is not afraid of change is teamwork. Due to the solid roots of 'teamwork', we were able to safely finish the event within a certain period despite a sudden change in venue. With this teamwork and this challenge, we will bear the fruits of countless 'creatives' on the Shinhan Data System. You have the ability to make people's lives more convenient by adding a 'reverse branch' mind to the technology that has been strengthened by the experience of various projects ""from the perspective of users, not from the perspective of station branch or developers."" For example, we found inconvenience from the user's point of view in the 'improvement of the inventory management system for clothing stores', and proposed a central inventory management system as an improvement measure. When using an online clothing store, there was an inconvenience of having to contact the store directly to check the inventory.I felt the need for a system that can check the changing stock situation in real time from the user's point of view. To this end, we proposed a central inventory management system, which is a method of delivering order information received from the central government by store. As a result, students were impressed by how they came up with this idea, and they ranked first in the convenience category. Based on the 'reverse branch' mindset of users looking at Shinhan Data system from the perspective of users, not developers, I will accurately understand users' needs and minimize the inconvenience users feel. ""What's the good thing that makes you laugh when you meet?"" It's a word that can describe me, 'bright energy.' In preparation for the contest, I raised the spirits of my team members with bright energy. I prepared surprise snacks for my team members who were tired of a series of overnight meetings, and I used my energy to recharge by eating them, and safely finished preparing for the contest. At that time, the team members nicknamed them 'OOO' by asking what good things happened to them that made them smile so much when they meet. I will be the 'OOO' of Shinhan Data System, which never loses its smile in any bad work."
"The ability to see the forest and coordinate the whole thing is necessary for a system that maximizes convenience. He majored in industrial engineering and worked on a number of projects to improve the existing system, and in the process of deriving the optimal system, he has grown into a person who looks at the forest and coordinates the whole thing. For example, I was working on a project under the theme of ""Improving the Course Registration System in Schools,"" and I thought about how to maximize the convenience of classmates who use the course registration system. As a result of grasping the functions and data flow delivered by the course registration system and contemplating directly by the user's position, I found the inconvenience of not meeting the needs of students. In response, we proposed an improvement plan that reflected the information on the number of people surveyed through the application for the desired lecture, and received great response from the classmates. The ability to see the forest and coordinate the whole thing and the affection as a customer of Korea Trade Information and Communication will create synergy, making the system development job ""an act of repaying the affection for Korea Trade and Communication"" rather than just a workplace. ""My History Is the History of Korea Trade Information and Communication."" As IT convergence, an convergence between IT and other industries, has been actively conducted, I realize that IT is indispensable for the industry. While majoring in industrial engineering, I was fascinated by IT that supported the smooth operation of the industry, and I applied to create a convenient world with IT along with Korea Trade information and communication. Korea Trade information and communication is achieving 'green growth without paper documents' by pioneering the Korean electronic document industry, such as accredited electronic document centers and e-commerce transactions. Just as the saying goes, 'The history of Korea Trade information and communication is the history of Korea's electronic trade', I want to mark a milestone in the history of electronic trade by creating a convenient world with IT. I have developed two competencies to be reborn as talented people suitable for the Korea Trade information and communication IT jobs. ""First, competencies required to perform tasks."" IT personnel must have an understanding of the industry as well as development skills. During my undergraduate years, I developed the ability to clearly grasp the characteristics of the industry by conducting various projects that combine IT and industry, such as smart factory design using cloud computing and improvement of inventory management systems for clothing stores. In addition, I majored in statistics twice and learned statistical programming such as SAS and R, so I developed my numerical analysis and data analysis skills. Currently, I am taking an applied SW engineer training course at the KH Information Education Center and learning Java, HTML5, JSP, JQuery, SQL, Spring Framework, and MyBatis. Using the learned knowledge, I acquired practical experience by conducting development projects such as 'free video lecture sites' and 'used auction sites'. ""Second, competencies required for company life' Office workers prefer broken new employees the most. Working as an intern at a research company, I developed my ability to handle broken jobs. For example, when I was instructed by the assistant manager to call the survey subjects once more every 30 minutes, I called those who were absent once more at every 30 minutes, and left text messages for those who still did not answer. In addition, I have learned the basics of company life, such as greeting brightly and taking notes on tasks you ordered immediately, which are trivial but should not be overlooked. I will make a bold mark in the history of Korea Trade Information and Communication by using all of these capabilities. There are two things I want to do in the Korea Trade Information Communication (KOTI). First, developing an intuitive system for middle-aged and elderly people. Seeing my parents who are not familiar with using mobile and Internet public certificates, I thought I would like to develop a more intuitive and convenient system for middle-aged and elderly people. I will work hard to develop and operate a button with the user's convenience in every single location. ""Second, developing an independent open source"" In order for KOTI to grow into a global leader, I think it is urgent to develop an independent open source. We will develop our own system that is simple and highly secure to create KOTI that is differentiated and competitive. In this way, what I ultimately want to do is to deliver convenience to everyone who works with KOTI. I will follow the next steps to achieve my goal. I will focus on learning the work process by going to work 30 minutes early every day after joining the company. After five years of joining the company, I will constantly learn new IT technologies so as not to be eliminated from the rapidly changing IT environment. In addition, I will continue to study foreign languages to enhance my competitiveness in the global era. I will always look at Korea Trade Information and Communication from the customer's point of view and constantly strive to minimize the inconvenience that customers feel. Ten years after joining the company, I will become a global IT expert who can be a leader in the e-trade market and a cornerstone for the growth of the future of the global paperless industry. I have been reborn as a person who values collaboration in the process of encouraging team members who have faced difficulties by carrying out the ""Korea Trade Information and Communication Co-worker"" project to improve the inventory management system of clothing stores. To make matters worse, there was a team member who was left behind in a situation where a small number of people had to bear a large amount of work because the team member who was in charge of PM was excluded in the middle of the process due to early employment. Judging that I lacked basic knowledge of diagrams because I was a double major student, I delivered the materials I referred to when I took the programming course and helped my team members understand by giving me questions and answers through messengers in my spare time. At first, it was somewhat difficult to understand unfamiliar concepts such as objects and attributes, but as a result of steadily helping me learn, I improved greatly enough to write DFD on my own. I was very overwhelmed and burdened with time just by my task, but I did my best by reflecting on the fact that it was a common goal, not just my own. As a result, everyone was able to actively participate without falling behind and produce high-quality results.I will be the co-worker of Korea Trade Information Technology (KITA) that demonstrates my core weapon of cooperation in the IT industry. I have the experience of enhancing the efficiency of projects with my bright energy in preparation for the ""OOO of KITA"" contest. Due to the long delay in selecting the topic, I had to stay up all night every other day from the time a week before the submission period. Everyone was tired, but my bright energy encouraged the team members to do it, and I completed the preparation for the contest safely within this period. At that time, the team members gave me the nickname of 'OOO' because what good thing happened that made me smile so much that I could meet them. I will be OOO who smiles brightly in any event."
"""Collaboration, DNA in my blood vessels"" The DNA in my blood vessels is 'collaboration'. While working as an intern, which is my first social experience and external activities with team members with different majors, I felt that 'the power stemming from collaboration is greater than the power of a single person with excellent ability'. Since then, I have been practicing collaboration by using DNA. For example, through collaboration in the 'Improvement of the in-school course registration system' project, I obtained the results of the 7th interim evaluation and 2nd final evaluation. There was a team member who was a PM because of early employment, and to make matters worse, I was left behind when the team member was neglected. I was a team member who lacked basic knowledge of UML because I majored in multiple majors. Judging that I would not be able to produce results within the period if I overlooked the team member, I delivered reference materials, assisted in Q&A, and filled in the shortcomings of the team member. I felt a lot of time pressure as I had to have repeated overnight meetings from a week before the final evaluation, and I was overwhelmed just with my task. However, when I first learned UML, I tried to understand the situation of my team member by recalling the old self-imposed difficulties, and I tried my best to recall that it was a common goal rather than a goal alone. As a result, we were able to attract everyone's participation without a single dropout. If there is a colleague who is struggling even after joining the emergency education company, I will be willing to self-proclaim and demonstrate collaboration to share and lead the difficulties together to produce results. I set my goal of ""achieving 100 points in bowling"" as ""like working is playing,"" and I achieved it by happily immersing myself in it. It has been more than a year since I started bowling, but I had a poor score of over 50 to 60 points because I lacked athletic ability. As a result of studying the players' attitudes while watching videos and trying to achieve 100 points by being coached by a friend who is good at bowling, I was able to achieve 115 points in just three months. I think I was able to achieve thrilling results because I enjoyed bowling as a means to relieve stress. I am also confident that I will perform my work happily as if I play. Through persistence, I overcame difficulties I encountered through the project ""I am the icon of persistence"" and ""Development of a used auction site."" Since it was my first time folding data processing in the form of Multipleart, errors occurred frequently in the process of implementing the membership function of uploading profile pictures. Frequent errors and complicated source code undermined my morale, but I did not give up, immediately asking questions that I did not know enough to jokingly hear ""pay extra private tuitions to the teacher."" After class, I studied individually through Toby's Spring book and Googling, and as a result, I was second among the six teams. I learned that there is nothing I can't do if I have the perseverance not to give up no matter what the difficulties I face. ""Bright Energy-rich medium of communication."" My strength is ""Bright energy."" In preparation for the contest, I used my bright energy to cheer my team members up. I prepared surprise snacks for my team members who were tired of a series of sleepovers, and even tapped into the role of mood maker by presenting funny images at times. At the time, they gave me the nickname ""OOO,"" saying they had never met a bright friend like you. My complement is ""strong desire to win."" I often get excessive stress when I fail to fulfill my desired goal. After finishing second out of the six teams in the sports competition that I participated in when I was a freshman, I had an experience that hindered my studies because I couldn't get my hands on things all day. I am trying to see the situation with a positive thought that even if I fail to overcome my shortcomings, another good thing will come. I found a compromise through communication in the 'Free Video Lecture Site Development' project. While implementing the quarterly competition functions, there were divided opinions on whether to post individual questions or in groups of 20 questions. Since I couldn't overlook any of the opinions, I compromised by posting 5 questions per difficulty level, considering the project schedule and DB performance, and led the satisfaction of the team members. I will become the 'communication medium' of emergency education that derives the optimal decision-making by collecting everyone's voices through an open return. 'Emergency Education Convergence Talent' They are convergent talents who have the knowledge of information systems, development skills, and communication skills, which are the core competencies required to carry out digital education system planning. 1. When I was an undergraduate of information system knowledge, I learned methodologies such as object-oriented and CBD by working on projects such as 'improving the course application system' and 'improving the inventory management system of clothing stores'. Based on this, I developed my system analysis and design ability by expressing the system that reflects the requirements in modeling languages such as Use case and DFD. I will exert this knowledge to design the digital education system logic logically. 2. Development Competency Application SW Engineer Training conducted 'Free Video Lecture Site' and 'Second-hand Auction Site' development projects based on the Spring Framework to cultivate development competency. In addition, in order to develop a system that considers not only the accuracy of data but also its usability, I acquired SQLD certificate and developed my SQL writing ability. We will provide various educational services suitable for smart environments by demonstrating our development capabilities. 3. Through various team projects, internship experiences in the role of intermediary between the team leader and the interviewer, I have grown into a person who listens well, talks well, and knows how to solve well. Through smooth communication, I will break down the dialogue barriers caused by diversification of knowledge background and terminology inconsistency. ""Innovative Worker to open the era of digital textbooks along with emergency education"" With the experience of several projects, you can innovate your skills to maximize customer satisfaction. For example, he proposed a central inventory management system by innovating in the ""Improving Inventory Management System for Clothing Stores"" project.When using the online clothing store, there was an inconvenience of having to contact the store directly to check the inventory. As an improvement, we proposed a central inventory management system, which is a method of delivering order information received from the center by store. In order to differentiate it from the existing system, we added a function to recommend stores close to the customer's location through GPS location-based service. As a result, I was deeply impressed by how I could come up with this idea among the students, and I tasted the joy of winning first place in the creativity category, along with the favorable reviews from the professor in charge of the system that is innovative enough to be sold right away. I think innovation must be added to the service in order to truly impress customers by competing with various existing IT services. We will create a better educational environment with digital education services that add innovation and support emergency education that leads the educational culture of Korea. Emergency education will be an Innovative Worker that can serve as the cornerstone for emerging as a leader in smart convergence education that will open the era of digital textbooks."
"""Consideration and communication for consensus."" The commitment I think is to spare no voluntary effort to achieve the goal. In the process of planning the festival as a representative of the grade, I devoted myself to reaching an agreement, believing that consideration and communication were the center of collaboration. Since the festival is one of the university events that college students look forward to the most, I made different resolutions to plan an event that satisfies everyone. In the process of sharing opinions through meetings, it was difficult to coordinate opinions due to differences in positions of each department. It was expected that it would take a lot of time to reach an agreement by raising profitability in the general affairs department, interest in students in the planning department, and external aspects in the chairman and vice-chairman. To solve this problem, I asked for guidelines from each department. Based on the guidelines, I continued to mediate opinions to hold events that satisfies everyone, emphasizing consideration and understanding with each other, and reaching consensus that students could be satisfied within the budget. I think the reason why they disagree within the same organization is that their responsibilities are different. Accordingly, I experienced that it was possible to accurately grasp each responsibility and requirement, consider each other's position, and communicate with each other, and derive satisfactory results. I will become a professional application operator of Hanwha S&C that seeks consensus and facilitates smooth work by drawing consideration and communication from people from various positions. I took the major course of ""Team Project that Successfully Completed Despite Limited Time and Few Team Members"" and proceeded with the team project to develop new services and model business. All of the team members participated in the project with enthusiasm, and the theme was to freely share opinions and develop a ""School Notice Notification App"". In addition, the project seemed to go smoothly, presenting various functions to be implemented, such as favorites, push notification, and history functions. However, due to the small number of team members of 3, it was difficult to proceed with the project, and to make matters worse, the announcement date was two weeks later. Although there were conflicts of opinion among team members due to limited time and heavy workload, they did not give up, and they mediated the opinions of team members, planned schedules, and distributed tasks together. As a result, through systematic division of labor and schedule management, we were able to successfully complete modeling, reports, and presentations within a limited time. Through this project experience, I realized the importance of systematic division of labor and schedule management, and above all, I was able to cultivate a sense of cooperation by striving to achieve a common goal. When I conducted a team project while taking the liberal arts course of the ""Team Project led by a team leader with a self-righteous personality,"" I had a difficult experience because of the team leader who did not know how to care and worked on the team project. In the process of sharing opinions, the team leader ignored and refused to accept the opinions of the team members if he had different opinions from himself, and proceeded with the project by sticking to his own opinions. As a result, all of the team members became dissatisfied with the team leader, and eventually lost interest in the project and ruined the project. Based on the importance of consideration and communication learned through this experience, I will strive to make all members of the organization become one of the common goals of corporate development at Hanwha S&C. By combining the perspective of optimization that industrial engineering aims for and the practical experience of the IT job, I made the following efforts to become a talented person suitable for the application operation job. First, in order to provide optimal IT services to customers in various industries, an understanding of the customer's industry must be the basis. As an industrial engineering student, I dealt with various fields and developed the perspective of optimization and problem-solving ability. In addition, by studying my major, I improved my understanding of information systems. I have developed the ability to design the system architecture and database, model requirements and processes, and visualize through UML. Based on this, I challenged the information processing engineer, passed the written test, and am about to take the practical test. Second, I gained practical experience through internships and acquired IT skills by dealing with Java, Oracle, and JSP. In addition, I learned to work with a large number of people to effectively achieve the common goal and the responsibility of performing the tasks of individuals within the organization to the end. Third, I developed my communication skills through student meetings and improved my ability to identify needs with customers through sales sales. In addition, I have grown into a global talent who is not afraid to communicate with foreigners through language training. Since I have these capabilities, I am confident that I am suitable for the job of operating an application that requires me to communicate with customers in various fields and accurately grasp the needs of customers. ICT technologies such as artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things are converging into existing technologies and services or combining them with new technologies in various fields to connect products and services through a network, intelligentize things, and the Fourth Industrial Revolution is emerging as a major topic in the industry. Through this, technologies and services are becoming more 'SMART', and as technology evolves, the needs of customers that change in various and complex ways are becoming 'CREATIVE'. In order not to be eliminated from the current IT industry, I think it is essential to develop more SMART and CREATIVE technologies and services in line with rapidly changing trends. While taking the information system analysis design, I proceeded with a project to improve and model the school's integrated system U-Dream's. Our team found it inconvenient that updates on service hours, external activities, and award-winning entries in the competition were made only in a face-to-face manner among the functions of the system. This was improved in a non-face-to-face manner in which when the student uploaded the documents to the storage and requested approval, the faculty and staff checked and processed them every day for approval, and the manager updated the academic information, which was applied to the actual school integration system and gave a great sense of achievement. Just as we implement a SMART system with a CREATIVE posture, rather than just passing the inconvenience of daily life, we will be a member of Hanwha S&C that realizes greater value with a SMART&CREATIVE posture."
"""Developer who gives convenience"" My goal is to become a developer who turns the prevalent inconveniences into convenience. For example, when I was an undergraduate, I was able to provide convenience to myself and my classmates through the ""Introduction to Coverage Management System."" I felt proud of myself for development through this experience, and I thought that I would like to continue living as a developer with that mindset. As a developer of AhnLab, it would be security if I could think about what would meet my goals. But I don't think the general public can even feel the convenience because security doesn't show itself to the users directly. So, I may think that it doesn't meet my goal. However, I think that I can contribute as a developer who can indirectly give ""the convenience of safety"" by developing a Beckend of security software. Through this, I will become a developer 'OOO' who can contribute to AhnLab while achieving my goal. As time goes by, I will focus on discovering business by converging next-generation technologies into industries from startups to large companies. From this point of view, the need for a cloud that minimizes costs such as infrastructure construction, operation, and management, and increases productivity will greatly increase. In addition, general companies are also attempting to transform into IT companies through digital transformation. That's why the cloud market will become more active. What the cloud needs is 'security'. Currently, most companies are pursuing a private cloud. This is due to high security anxiety about public cloud. At this point, AhnLab developed a 'remote security control service' responsible for the security of the IBM cloud and is leading the security industry in the cloud market, such as being selected as the technical part of AWS. Therefore, if we continue to focus on cloud-based security businesses, we will be able to increase our competitiveness as a security company. I have experience in leading a project successfully by showing a sense of responsibility ""responsibility, the reason I was able to complete the project."" While working for the development club Nexters, I realized that individual responsibility is important for collaboration. At that time, the project did not progress because everyone was busy. So, I silently sent interim results on Back-End development, presented questions about ideas in the group chat room, and forced the project by matching API parameters with client developers. As a result, I developed it by dividing the time without my team members while watching myself working hard, and on weekends, I gathered and developed it for 8 hours. As a result, I was able to be selected as an excellent team within the club. Through this experience, I realized that individual responsibility can be helpful in order to draw out sincere cooperation from team members. I will become a talented person who can increase teamwork with a sense of responsibility, always thinking that it is my job. With the goal of becoming a ""challenge spirit"" Back-End developer, I found and challenged myself what I could do now. As a result, I built up my Back-End development capabilities through internship, development club, and seminar activity, and participated in hackathon to achieve the excellence award. I learned Java and Spring through the ""job experience"" intern, and Python and Django through the development club. I also learned how to develop cloud-based Back-End through attending AWS seminar. In addition, I have developed collaboration skills by utilizing Slack, Trello, Git, and Jenkins, and communication skills through development experiences with other occupations such as designers and planners. ""Active growth"" I have the strength of making efforts on my own to improve my own skills. For example, I have experience not only organizing knowledge learned through learning or experience, but also applying it to my own code and repecting it. I will always learn and grow on my own."
"Doosan is growing rapidly based on its outstanding technological prowess that leads the global market beyond the domestic market. Behind Doosan's growth in this way, I believe Doosan Information and Communication is supporting efficient IT systems. Information systems help departments that are physically and conceptually distant to perform their tasks by organically cooperating with them. This interest in information systems deepened when I took the information system analysis design, my major. It was attractive that the work environment, which naturally was used, was infused with efforts using IT technology. As a talented person who challenges new things with more curiosity than fear, I learned from Doosan Information and Communication, which provides advanced IT services and leads Doosan's growth, and with the passion to create a proud Doosan in the world with expertise. My strength is 'truthfulness'. When I work, I check every little part to see if things are going well. 'Is this enough?' This is what I said the most when I worked part-time at Subway. When I was making sandwiches to meet customers' needs, I asked their opinions and checked their satisfaction thoroughly. As a result, I gained regular customers, which led to increased sales. My meticulousness will be the driving force behind me in performing well without making a mistake because I have to perform small tasks well in any big task. On the other hand, it has the disadvantage of not being able to easily reject a request because I have a lot of affection. I almost missed the deadline for my assignment while helping another friend with an assignment. Since then, I have tried to compensate for my shortcomings by prioritizing and proceeding with consideration of the deadline and required time of the task when others ask for help. In the first semester of the 3rd year of the ""Team Project that successfully completed despite limited time and small number of team members"", I had the experience of improving the U-Dream, an integrated system of Dongguk University, as a team project by taking an information system analysis design, which is a mandatory subject for my major. The problem that our team came up with was that there are time and space constraints that require you to submit the original copy directly to the relevant department in order to input and modify service hours, external activities, and award-winning entries in the competition among the functions of the integrated system. We looked at this from the user's point of view and tried to systematically improve it. Instead of a face-to-face method in which the student must submit the original document directly to the department through a meeting, when the student uploaded the document to the storage and requested approval, the faculty and staff checked and approved it every day, and the administrator decided to improve the system in a non-face-to-face manner in which academic information was updated. However, the small number of team members, such as three, made it difficult to proceed with the project. To make matters worse, the presentation date was two weeks later, and due to the limited time and heavy workload, there were conflicts of opinion among team members. Despite difficult circumstances, we mediated the opinions of team members, planned schedules, and evenly distributed tasks. The project was carried out through systematic division of labor and schedule management, and as a result, we were able to successfully complete modeling, reports, and presentations within a limited time of two weeks. There were many difficulties in carrying out the project, but I felt a great sense of accomplishment in the process of fulfilling my goals by responding passionately without giving up. In addition, it was rewarding as the part that was improved with the project was applied to the system later. With the cooperative spirit cultivated through the team project, we will try to make all members of the organization one of the common goals of corporate development in Doosan."
"CJ's new distribution business is leading the globalization of Korean culture by exporting various products and brands from Korea to overseas. Behind the growth of the new distribution business like this, I believe CJ Olive Networks is supporting an efficient work environment. I think the company is another starting point in my life. So, when I select a company, I think about whether it is a company that can achieve sustainable growth rather than just looking at the current situation. In this regard, CJ Olive Networks is realizing customer satisfaction by providing optimal IT services and is continuously growing. In addition, it is not complacent at the present time, but has an innovative vision of 'DIGITAL NO.1 SMART VALUE CREATOR', and I think there are more ways to go than up the road. 'Industrial engineering students who know the importance of systems' information systems are important systems that help numerous departments that are separated by conceptual and physical distance organically cooperate to perform their tasks. Only when a good system is in place so that the company's efforts to achieve its goals work effectively, it can conduct its work efficiently and generate profits. Interest in such information systems deepened when I took the information system analysis design, which is a department class. It was attractive that efforts using IT technology were permeated into the work environment that was naturally used. In order to perform the system operation task, I have the following knowledge. First, I majored in industrial engineering and took major courses in various fields such as distribution and IT, so I have the ability to solve problems from a broad perspective. My competence as an industrial engineering student will be the basis for understanding the customer's business and suggesting the optimal alternative. Second, I developed my collaboration skills through student council and improved my communication skills with customers through sales. In addition, through language training, I have grown into a global talent who is not afraid to communicate with foreigners. This will contribute to realizing customer satisfaction through smooth communication. ""Excellent intern achieved in the posture of learning"" I have experience working as an intern in the web development part of the R&D team through long-term field training. Without much knowledge of web development, my first job as designing bulletin boards was not easy. However, I constantly tried to build up the knowledge necessary for my work and was able to write the continuously advanced code. At first, it was simply implemented in the JAVA Console window, but after that, the database was connected using the bulletin board ERD and JDBC, and the code was modified by applying the Connection Pool to reduce the load on the database. In addition, I learned and applied JSP, and wrote the continuously advanced code. As a result, I was able to implement the final answer-type bulletin board. Realizing that I was lacking while working on other tasks, I borrowed books from senior researchers to learn, take internet lectures, and make efforts to solidify basic skills in order to gain knowledge about web development such as JAVA, DB SQL, JSP, and JDBC during personal time outside of work hours. As a result, I was able to complete the tasks that I had decided to do during the field training earlier than expected, and I had the opportunity to participate in the Hazardous Blocking Service project that I was conducting with the Office of Education at the suggestion of a senior researcher. In addition, after the internship period was over, the school awarded scholarships to me because I received good reviews from the company. I felt that the ceaseless effort to make up for my shortcomings with a learning attitude was an indispensable virtue for me to improve myself. I gained two things from this experience. First, it was my experience in IT practice. It was a great experience to see, hear, feel, and deeply understand IT tasks in the field as well as my knowledge of web development. Second, it is a sense of challenge that does not avoid difficult tasks. I will become a new employee of CJ Olive Networks, which remembers the progress I made as an intern, passionately challenging all tasks, and takes on the learning attitude. As CJ Group provides lifestyle-oriented services such as CGV and Olive Young, it maintains a very high public recognition and market share. However, I learned that CJ Olive Networks' market share in Korea is less than 2 percent. I will raise its market share to the 10% level by 2027 with CJ Olive Networks, which strives to improve its market share through continuous IT innovation and maximization of IT efficiency. ""Customer trust determines CJ Olive Networks' future."" It is the customers that have led CJ Olive Networks today. The future of CJ Olive Networks will also depend on how many customers trust and use CJ Olive Networks. I will practice two things to gain customer trust. First, I will contribute to realizing customer satisfaction service by insighting the customer's needs as well as potential wants. I have experience in securing customers by making sandwiches according to customers' needs and grasping not only needs but also wants. We achieved an increase in sales by securing regular customers by satisfying the needs of customers who do not put vegetables they dislike and wants to add more vegetables they like. Second, we will contribute to providing standardized services to customers by creating standard operation procedures based on work experience and IT knowledge. I have experience working as a field manager at CJ CGV and trained on the importance of Standard Operating Procedures (SOP). If we handle customer requirements according to SOP, we can systematically handle homogeneous tasks so that we can make decisions and respond quickly to situations. In addition, we will be able to gain customer trust by providing consistent service. 'When members of an organization grow, companies grow together.' This is the organizational values I have. I will continue to develop myself with these values and become an employee who continues to grow with CJ Olive Networks."
"""Global leader achieved through passion"" The three months of language training in Canada, which was short but full of experiences, are unforgettable experiences. Before going on language training, I set my goal to come back with the best experience that I could not forget even though it was a short period of time. In order to realize my goal, I made a small group called ""Enjoy Canada"" with my friends from the language school. I made a small group and tried to make fun memories by inviting friends of various nationalities. However, the operation was not as easy as various people gathered together. There were two major problems. First, it was a language barrier. Most of my friends were not fluent in English, so I had a hard time getting to know each other by having conversations with friends who mainly spoke the same language. In order to solve this problem, I first led conversations about my poor English skills and promoted friendship. Second, it was the difference of cultures. In order to understand the different cultures of each country, I tried to have time to exchange cultures. Especially, I made a time to teach drinking culture in Korea by drinking soju at Korean restaurants. This was a great response from my foreign friends, so I had a chance to get closer to my foreign friends. The proactive attitude to make good memories hanging out with friends I've never seen in a strange country has not only improved my English skills but also improved my communication skills and developed me into a global leader. SK Hynix's IT jobs are to propose, design, build, and maintain optimal systems. In order to build an optimal system, requirements must be investigated and analyzed, and in the process, I believe that communication skills are a virtue as important as competence in IT technology. I will try to provide the optimal system based on smooth communication. ""100-meter Runner's Challenge to Enter Engineering College"" Due to my athletic career, I started my day on the field unlike other friends and spent most of my time on the field. I started studying in high school and quit athletics due to frequent injuries, so I started studying for college entrance. I started studying late, but I set my goal of going to a four-year university in Seoul since I started doing it. In order to achieve my goal, I tried with physical strength and persistence developed by exercising more than other friends, thinking about ""one more hour, one more."" At first, I asked my homeroom teacher for help because I didn't know how to study. My teacher recommended me to study anew from the middle school course, and I built my foundation by studying from the middle school course. At first, it was difficult because I didn't seem to see any progress in my studies, but I didn't give up and continued to get better grades every time on the test. As a result of my efforts, I was able to achieve good grades in my university exams. Through this experience, I have realized from experience that efforts are not betrayed. Since then, I have not given up even in difficult situations, and I am slowly working on small things and solving them through efforts. I will not give up on any difficulties I face while working at SK Hynix and contribute to building and operating an optimal IT environment. ""Open the customer's wallet"" ""Up-sell excellent OO"" This is my title that I wore for three consecutive months while working as an OO manager at OOO. In the case of the branch where I was, I found out that sales at the store rather than ticket sales have a greater impact on sales than at other branches because there were fewer visitors than at other branches from March to June and September to November, which is called the off-season. I worked together on the goal of the branch and achieved the customer price of 11,500 won when the average customer price of the combo nationwide was less than 10,000 won, and was selected as the best up-sell smiley face in the branch. The reason why I was able to achieve this customer price was not just because I sold hard as ordered by the customer, but because I identified the types of customers and induced up-sell accordingly. When the customers were lovers, we induced sales to women who were more sensitive to food than men, and in the case of the family, we conducted up-sell as children's promotional products focusing on children, or decided on the composition of combo products to be recommended according to the number of members, and up-sell was carried out accordingly. In addition, in the case of a single audience, we were able to increase the unit price of a combo and a single customer by inducing sales as a single product rather than an inexpensive combo. With this strategic sale, we were able to increase the customer price and were selected to be excellent smiley face. In addition, my sales method contributed to the increase in sales at the branch by affecting the motives of working together. Through this up-sell experience, I was able to quickly grasp the given situation and maximize the effectiveness of my work. Even after joining the company, I will become a member of SK Hynix, which constantly builds and operates an optimal IT environment based on differentiated thoughts. ""From the unique presentation method through role play to winning the award,"" I received a silver award for introducing a differentiated presentation method called role play with three team members in a technical report preparation and presentation competition under the theme of ""RFID Technology."" In the process of preparing for the presentation, I thought it would be difficult to understand only after hearing the presentation about the technology I first encountered, so I thought a lot about the presentation method. After thinking about it, I suggested to the team members what it would be like to proceed with the role play as part of the parts necessary for technology and participate in the presentation together. However, the team members refused to do so due to the fear of the presentation and the fact that it would take a long time to prepare. I persuaded them by presenting this as a role play once and presenting it in front of the team members in the existing presentation method, and I was able to gain the consent of the team members. As a result, through our differentiated presentation method, we were able to attract students' attention and help most students understand. In addition to this, I was selected as a class representative and received a silver award by participating in a presentation competition hosted by the engineering college. Through these experiences, I was able to experience the importance of trying a creative approach and having a differentiated competitiveness from others.In addition, no matter what I do afterwards, I am trying to bring out better results by finding new ways without having a stereotype. I have experience as an intern in the web development part of the R&D team through a long-term field training program that I participated in to gain experience in the job of ""Excellent Intern achieved in the posture of learning."" The first task of designing a bulletin board was not easy for me, as I did not have much knowledge of web development. However, in order to gain knowledge necessary for work, I borrowed books from senior researchers to learn, take Internet lectures, and make constant efforts to solidify basic skills, and I was able to write continuously advanced codes. At first, it was simply implemented in the JAVA Console window, but a database was built using bulletin board ERD and Oracle, and it was connected to the bulletin board using JDBC. In addition, the code was modified by applying the Connection Pool to reduce the load on the database. Finally, by applying JSP, I was able to finally implement an answerable bulletin board. After that, as a result of continuous learning and continuous effort in the given task with a learning attitude, I was able to complete the tasks that were supposed to be carried out during the field training faster than expected, and I had the opportunity to participate in the hazard prevention service project that I was conducting with the Office of Education at the suggestion of a senior researcher. In addition, after the internship period was over, the school awarded me a scholarship because I received good evaluation from the company. In this process, I felt that the constant effort to make up for my shortcomings with a learning attitude was an indispensable virtue for developing oneself. I gained two things from this experience. First, my experience in IT practice. I was able to see, hear, feel, and deeply understand the IT job as well as my knowledge of web development. Second, it is a sense of challenge that does not avoid difficult tasks. I will become a new employee of SK Hynix, remembering the progress I made with a learning attitude, and passionately challenging all tasks and working with a learning attitude. I have made consistent efforts to become a talented person suitable for my IT job as follows. First, while majoring in industrial engineering, I tried to take various major courses and have a broad perspective. Your competence as an industrial engineer will be the basis for understanding the whole industry and suggesting the best alternative. Second, I completed the ABEEK in Engineering Education Certification Course and carried out team projects in various subjects such as information system analysis design, service engineering, and management information system. Through this team project, I learned a sense of responsibility to perform the tasks assigned by individuals in the organization to the end and how to cooperate with a large number of people to effectively achieve common goals. This experience in team projects will be helpful in solving situations that I experience while working on practical tasks after joining SK Hynix. Third, I developed my collaboration skills through student council and improved my communication skills with customers through sales sales. In addition, I have grown into a global talent who is not afraid to communicate with foreigners through language training. It will contribute to realizing customer satisfaction through smooth communication. Through the knowledge and practical experience acquired during my undergraduate years, my goal is to become an IT expert who can operate all systems within five years. ""Team Project Successfully Completed Despite Limited Time and Few Team Members"" In the first semester of the third year, I had experience in team projects by taking information system analysis design, which is a mandatory subject for my major. Our team carried out the project with the aim of improving and modeling our school's integrated system, OOO. The problem that our team came up with was that among the functions of the OOO system, there are time and space constraints that require the person to submit the original copy directly to the relevant department in a limited time for entry and correction of service hours, external activities, and award-winning entries in the contest. We tried to improve this systematically from a user's point of view. When a student uploads the document to the storage and requests approval through a meeting, rather than a face-to-face method in which the student must submit the original copy directly to the department, the teacher and staff checked it every day, and the administrator decided to improve the system in a non-face-to-face manner in which the academic information was updated. However, the project was difficult due to the small number of team members of three. To make matters worse, the set presentation date was two weeks later, and due to limited time and heavy workload, there was also a conflict of opinion among team members. However, we did not give up, mediated the opinions of team members, planned schedules together, and distributed each task evenly. The project was carried out through systematic division of labor and schedule management, and as a result, we were able to successfully complete modeling, reports, and presentations within two weeks. There were many difficulties in carrying out the project with limited time and a small number of people, but I felt a great sense of accomplishment in the process of passionately coping with the goal without giving up. In addition, what we improved with the project was applied to OOOO later, and it was improved and rewarding. With the teamwork cultivated through the team project, SK Hynix will strive to become one of the common goals of corporate development."
"""Growth process - responsible person, OOO"" My parents always told me that being responsible for my actions is the most important factor in living. Influenced by my parents, I have also always tried to be a responsible person. When I was a child, I was on my way to the pharmacy to buy medicine for my sick sister, and I met my friend and played with her, but I forgot my purpose and came home empty-handed late. When I came home, my sister, who was waiting for her medicine, had a fever. I felt guilty when I saw my condition deteriorated due to my actions, and my parents begged me that promises are important, no matter how trivial, and that I should always act with responsibility. As a young me, at first I simply had the concept of feeling sorry for my sister and responsibility because I didn't want to be scolded by my parents. However, growing up, I realized that if I act responsibly every moment, I will achieve results that match, so I made responsibility my life belief. I want to contribute to the continuous profit creation of the company by taking advantage of various projects and IT internship experience in system development and maintenance. I will become a system expert who contributes to the development of the company by developing and providing systems by always putting the value of my customers first and using responsibility, which is my main weapon. ""Internship - I will drive the growth of the company based on my attitude of learning and practical experience."" I challenged the internship to experience the practice with the expectation and enthusiasm that I want to learn more than the existing knowledge and become a more professional talent. Through this, I worked as an intern in the R&D team for 4 months at OOOO and planned and developed a customer management web project. During the first month, I planned the overall structure and design of the project by drawing a storyboard while building a development environment. In the process of developing after finishing planning, I had difficulties because it was my first time developing the web. However, with the passion to learn, I sought advice from senior researchers, and constantly tried to learn by myself through Internet lectures and books to develop my job understanding skills. Based on what I learned, after linking Java with Oracle using MyBatis, I implemented functions such as registration, modification, deletion, and inquiry of customer information, wrote continuously advanced code, and I was able to develop a customer management web page. I have such a passion to challenge myself to learn new knowledge and develop existing knowledge. Based on my job understanding skills gained through internships, I will quickly and accurately understand the work and demonstrate practical skills to enhance the performance of the work. In addition, I will always learn and challenge in a humble manner, and take the lead in driving the growth of the company. ""Team Project - Team Project that successfully completed despite limited time and few team members"" In the first semester of the third year, I took an information system analysis design, which is a required subject of my major, and improved Eudreams, an integrated system of OO University, as a team project. The problem that our team came up with was that there are time and space constraints that require you to submit the original copy directly to the relevant department for input and correction of service hours, external activities, and award-winning entries in the competition among the functions of the integrated system. We looked at this from the user's point of view and tried to improve it systematically. Instead of a face-to-face method in which the student must submit the original document directly to the department through a meeting, when the student uploaded the document to the storage and requested approval, the faculty and staff checked and approved it every day, and the administrator decided to improve the system in a non-face-to-face manner in which academic information was updated. However, the small number of team members, such as three, made it difficult to proceed with the project. To make matters worse, the presentation date was two weeks later, and due to the limited time and heavy workload, there were conflicts of opinion among team members. Despite difficult circumstances, we mediated the opinions of team members, planned schedules, and evenly distributed tasks. The project was carried out through systematic division of labor and schedule management, and as a result, we were able to successfully complete modeling, reports, and presentations within a limited time of two weeks. There were many difficulties in carrying out the project, but I felt a great sense of accomplishment in the process of fulfilling my goals by responding passionately without giving up. In addition, it was rewarding as the part that was improved with the project was applied to the system later. With the cooperative spirit cultivated through the team project, we will strive to unite all members of the organization under the common goal of corporate development. ""Cooperation - Consideration and Communication for Consensus"" In the process of planning a festival as a representative of the grade, I believe that consideration and communication are the center of collaboration and I have experience in drawing consensus points from student council organizations. Since the festival is one of the university events that students look forward to the most, we have made different resolutions to plan an event that satisfies everyone. However, in the process of sharing opinions through meetings, it was difficult to coordinate opinions due to differences in positions of each department. The general affairs department had a conflict by raising profitability, the planning department by raising students' interest, and the chairman and vice chairman had an external aspect, and it was expected that it would take a lot of time to reach an agreement. To solve this problem, we set a schedule for future meetings and asked each department to present guidelines after sufficient meetings before then. Afterwards, based on the guidelines, we continued to mediate opinions to hold events that satisfy everyone, emphasizing consideration and understanding with each other, and were able to reach an agreement that students could satisfy within the budget. I think the reason why we disagree even within the same organization is that we have different responsibilities. As a result, I experienced that it was possible to accurately grasp each responsibility and requirement, consider each other's position, and communicate with each other, and derive satisfactory results. I will become a new employee who finds an agreement and promotes smooth work by drawing consideration and communication from people from various positions.""Challenge - Language Study with Your Own Money"" When I was undergraduate, I planned to study the language to gain various experiences. It was not easy to raise funds for language study from students, but I set a challenging goal to ease the burden on my parents and go there with my own money for a more meaningful experience. With the passion of achieving my goals, I worked part-time and planned to save about 150,000 won per month. I am sometimes tempted and unable to carry out my plans, so I am used to keeping short-term plans, but I realized that I lack practical skills to keep long-term plans. As a result of saving money separately and making efforts to live with the rest of my life, I was able to collect 10 million won in Canadian language study. Through this experience, I realized the importance of goals and the passion to achieve them. After going through language study, I set goals thoroughly, made a habit of planning and putting them into practice in order to achieve them, and I ended up living a more planned and targeted life."
"When choosing a company or job, I choose based on two criteria. First, is it the company that can best demonstrate my capabilities? I was trained in the Big Data Manager course organized by the IT OOOO Association, and learned JAVA, Oracle, and Hadoop through the training. And based on this, I worked on four team projects with people from other majors, such as humanities, statistics, and others, not with my majors. Through this experience of collaboration, I was able to gain practical communication skills and development-related skills through development experience. CJ Olive Networks is conducting its business by applying big data to the marketing and distribution sectors, and its future direction of development is the fusion of more diverse fields and big data technologies. I thought that I could best match the capabilities I have developed in the development of big data processing systems, which will become more and more important to CJ. Second, is it a company that I can learn from? When I was a freshman, I joined a programming club to improve my programming skills. By using basic education and public lecture time, I developed my programming skills through information exchange about programming with seniors. After joining the company, I will grow through learning and become a member of CJ Olive Networks, which contributes to the development of the CJ Olive Networks system. I participated in and challenged the Campus OO Strategy Universiade. First, the main components of the patent were analyzed to understand the patent and technology in question. However, there was a limit to understanding the technology at the company level. So, I searched for basic books related to technology and studied them deeply, and tried to understand the technology by reading explanations on the background technology in hundreds of papers. Then, I found related patents and papers based on the technology analysis. I found a total of five core prior art documents related to this patent out of thousands of patents obtained by searching the main components of the patent with keywords. Since the patent in question was a U.S. patent, I was able to find a product from Cisco that is highly likely to have infringed on this patent as a result of persistent review of the data sheets of the products related to this patent by the leading communication companies in the U.S. And, judging that there is a possibility that this patent may be invalidated through the prior art documents, I suggested an avoidance design that constitutes the patent by changing the core parts that may be infringed in a different way. Through the total analysis, we found the possibility of other prior patent infringement as well as the product that infringed on the company's patents. Through this experience, when I encounter difficulties after joining CJ Olive Networks, I will make plans and overcome them with a sense of responsibility and enthusiasm as if I had set up procedures to solve the problem, rather than running into them recklessly. I would like to join CJ Olive Networks and challenge to develop and operate a customized system that accurately predicts and provides services and products needed by customers by analyzing the data of customers and potential customers. At this time, I would like to develop a system based on a service with a story, not just a system. It is a service for customers who have targeted stories such as services that can be experienced with children by analyzing customer data, well-being O2O services for middle-aged people, products for children, and connection with camping-related services. For the DB analysis and system development of these services, in the short term and personally, I will further increase the capabilities of DB analysis. I would like to further develop practical skills through training such as the 'Database Manager Course', which is currently being trained, and in the long run, I would like to develop a customized system through the capacity of DB analysis and system development."
"""The convergence and collaboration skills that I have learned over the past two years"" I believe that the two strengths that I can confidently say are superior to other applicants are the convergence and collaboration skills, which correspond to the talent IBM wants. When I was working on a project to reduce the waiting time at a children's hospital, even though I was an engineer, I also participated in the work of observing and discovering problems at the hospital for three days. By going to the field, I was able to discover unexpected parts in the desk research process, and by experiencing all processes from the planning stage to the solution stage with humanities and design majors, I was able to develop my collaboration skills. As such, I feel proud and attached to technology-based human-centered research, and I am confident that the experiences that I have solved head-to-head will be able to solve future problems together at IBM. In the future, I would like to serve as the first mover of ICT, emotional, and design convergence technologies that bring out the ability to communicate according to the changing demands of the times based on user experience rather than technology. I became interested in Watson through a webinar conducted in April, and I had the experience of presenting a paper to the Korean Design Association a month later using a Watson API demo. The topic of the paper is ""Professional of Interactive Language Learning System (ILS) using ICT Technology,"" and the experiment was conducted using Watson's Visual Recognition, Text to Speech demo, which shows high recognition rate. Currently, I am testing a demo application on Android using TensorFlow, and I am reading papers related to deep learning every day to increase recognition rate. Last semester, I studied classification algorithms such as SVM and statistics through data mining class. Since June, I have participated in the research project ""Study for environmental performance and precision in fingerprinting and PDR technologies for indirect location estimation."" Since it is in the early stages of research, I am looking for related studies, and finally, the final goal is to estimate the indoor location more accurately and robustly through the deep learning process for wireless signals. In the 4th Industrial Revolution, IBM companies with cloud computing technology will change our world. I think cloud computing is at the highest level among all related technologies such as artificial intelligence, IoT, cloud computing, big data, mobile, and blockchain. Since the Internet of Things is also data-based, we will use IBM's cloud computing service, which collects data at a lower level and provides cloud services. Likewise, artificial intelligence will depend on cloud computing capabilities because it depends on how data is processed, classified, and interpreted. In the end, only companies with a lot of data will be given the opportunity to provide all of the above services, and I think we can lead the era of the 4th Industrial Revolution. There is not much time left when you will meet scenes that you have only seen in science fiction movies in real life. Even now, you can see them applied to your life one by two. I want to make the imaginary characters a reality with IBM. You can experience the design process and empathize with the design sensibility. It may be ironic that engineering majors are studying design, but I studied UX design because I thought it would be difficult to produce good products without going through the UX design process, which recognizes humanities values and emotions rather than technology in the Fourth Industrial Revolution. With the convergence of engineering-based core technology development learned while majoring in in information and communication electronics engineering, as well as research in the HCI and UX fields in graduate schools, we have the ability to efficiently develop mobile applications based on user experience in the future. Core technology will be included in all products and services, but the final end point for technology will be people. It will be better research if we understand and develop human contexts from the R&D stage. IBM already has world-class technology, so if research on humans, humans, and humans is conducted at the same time, it will be a recognized company until the end."
"As part of my employment activities, I made ceaseless efforts to obtain a certificate. I currently have a computer graphics operation technician, a web design technician, and an information processing technician/driver. As a computer major, I believe that obtaining an information processing certificate will be of great help to your computer system management. And I think that the graphics operation technician and the web design technician will be able to enhance the visual convenience of your company's web page production and management. In the case of English, I am taking TOEIC on a regular basis to improve my grades, and I plan to increase it to more than 800 points in the future. The main task of KEPCO KDN (hereinafter referred to as kdn) is to 'manufacture and manage overall computer systems of KEPCO and its affiliates'. For the efficient power control and management of KEPCO, a parent company, the role of kdn in charge of computer systems between companies, that is, websites and related software, is important. I believe that I can contribute to your computer management by reflecting this role of kdn. This is because, by obtaining a computer major and information processing technician license, I have a faster overall understanding of the computer system than other non-acquired people. Having obtained a computer graphics operating technician and a web design technician license, I believe that I can play a major role in visual convenience and intuitive interface, which are important for managing web pages. No matter how capable you are of creating a complete website with only web programming languages and text coding tools, lack of design aesthetic and visual layout will make users uncomfortable when browsing the website. It was when I was working on my graduation project. There were originally a total of three members in my team, including two members of the group, but the problem was that one of the group members was employed, but the problem was that they did not appear on the day of the mid-term course presentation or important interviews with the professor at all, and did not try to take on important roles such as programming or design, but only handed it over to me as the team leader. Also, one member of the other group also neglected to pass on all the tasks to me on the excuse that he had learned nothing. So I was faced with two difficulties, and I was wondering whether to persuade them to share roles and go with me to the end or to withdraw the team members. It was uncertain whether the team members who had no will would make the work properly if they led as it was, and on the contrary, if they withdrew the team members, there was a risk of being deducted from the group cooperation score. So I consulted the professor about this, called the team members, talked about it, then withdrew the already employed student, found what I could do and let the remaining one participate in the project. Fortunately, that judgment helped to go smoothly and I was able to complete it safely. As part of improving my professionalism, I made ceaseless efforts to obtain certification. I currently have computer graphics management technicians, web design technicians, information processing technicians, and information processing technicians, and I was originally interested in visual design as the reason for obtaining these certifications. In order to pioneer such a career path, I acquired a graphics management technician and a web design technician, and obtained an information processing license as a way to make use of my major subject in the future. As a computer major, I believe that obtaining an information processing license will be of great help to your computer system management, and I believe that graphics management and web design technicians will be able to enhance the visual convenience of your company's web page creation and interest. And speaking of school education, I have enhanced my understanding of the computer system you require by taking major subjects such as logic circuit, algorithm, operating system, computer structure, database, and software engineering, and by obtaining compliance credits for those subjects. I am sure that my experience will be helpful to you. As far as I know, employees of public corporations and public institutions are the face of the state. Their facial expressions, tone, and behavior are all visible to customers every day. Also, I think that the people indirectly judge the image of the government and the state and trust the government accordingly. In other words, I think that their office skills, service to customers, and public relations between individual employees are clearly linked to the trust of the people. This lack of ethical consciousness follows just from the irregularities within state agencies that occasionally appear in the news. There is a fear that the public's trust in the state will be reduced by watching such news, and that they will distrust the state and the government. Therefore, public officials should act carefully anytime, anywhere, with the mindset that they are truly an example for the people before these things happen. Above all, I think the attitude of making public affairs clear is the top priority for public officials."
"I learned how to meet various people and understand the differences by doing activities such as general student council, overseas travel, internship, overseas education volunteer work, etc., not just staying in the ""Athlet of Growth."" Experiences that may seem like a waste of time to someone required cooperation and communication, and were very helpful in the progress of development projects that needed to come up with appropriate solutions through quick understanding. As the project team leader, I was able to lead my team members without much conflict and achieve higher performance than others. In addition, while working as a research club for four years, I have been working on mobile, VR, and embedded projects, and have completed portfolios in various fields, not limited to one field. Through constant research in one field, I also published two papers and got the opportunity to present them at conferences. In addition, I participated in IT forums such as Han-eum, SOSCON, and the world IT competition to broaden my perspective on rapid technological trends. With these experiences, I want to grow further in the Korean Music Copyright Association and be with them. Due to the influence of my parents who like music, ""A Stage to Communicate"" I have lived a daily life since I was young. I have always dreamed of a career in music, but I majored in software for my career. However, while majoring in IT, I wanted to work in a field related to music that was daily, and I wanted to be a developer who provided value beyond just providing services. At first, I wondered if I could work in two areas that seemed completely unrelated. However, I was able to resolve my doubts by seeing the seniors who already work for the Korea Music Copyright Association and their confidence. So, I applied without hesitation to the Korea Music Copyright Association, which judged it to be the right stage for the field I was looking for. And in order to become a developer who can stand on that suitable stage, I will constantly improve to keep up with the ever-improving future path of the IT field. During the internship period of the ""Developer in-depth"" I had the opportunity to work on a project by myself from beginning to end. I planned a daycare center application and developed it for a month. As the development progressed, users varied even in one system, so analysis of users was needed to meet the needs of each user within one function. One of the implementation functions was the notification slip. I found that contacting parents outside of working hours was a burdensome part for teachers, but it was one of the essential parts for parents. After that, I thought of an intermediate point in which each user's needs could be all reflected. In the process, the notification slip function, which was previously planned in chat format, was changed into a bulletin board format and developed. After that, I made a final presentation on the project in front of the incumbent developers, and I was able to receive favorable reviews for developing the system that was considered from the perspective of each user. Above all, I was able to hear the unforgettable and valuable saying, ""Developer in depth."" ""I will continue to grow."" For the three years after joining the company, I will become a new employee who is not afraid of questions and works hard to understand the company-wide work and system as well as the duties given with an attitude of learning, acceptance, and challenge. In addition, I want to become an employee who makes sure the basics through constant learning and is proud of the company like my seniors. Through my accumulated experience, I will quickly judge the elements that need the system, maintain and repair the solutions required within them, and provide an optimized system for the user's point of view. And I will be an employee who plays a central role in leading the solutions to be provided in an efficient direction. In 10 years, I want to design solutions so that the services I develop and provide can be conveniently used by anyone, and I want to become a respected developer and a leading developer who can lead the team members who are working on the project, and this is my ultimate goal as a developer."
"""I am a developer with a spirit of challenge that does not give up."" He did not give up and challenged more than 20 times to win in four contests. I participated in related contests to experience the planning and development process with my team members through startup club activities. When I first challenged the contest, I thought that if I challenged with only good ideas, I could achieve results, so I simply participated in the contest. We analyzed the problems of eliminating 20 contests with our team members, and we participated in the contest by making sure to observe the following two points. First, a market analysis meeting was held every week to identify market issues and suggest ideas to solve them. Second, we tried to identify and minimize development issues that occur during the development process. As a result of participating in the above two contests, we achieved the result of winning in four contests after 20 challenges. Based on these experiences, I will analyze the market and demonstrate my ability to minimize development issues. ""Necessity to secure an IT technology infrastructure for construction IT technological innovation"" With the development of information and communication technology, I think it is time for the construction IT field to also face a new turning point. Looking at the recent IT convergence innovation cases in the construction industry, we are pursuing innovation in the fields of smart construction, city, and living by introducing technologies such as big data, artificial intelligence, and IoT. In this process, before discussing the growth direction of lakeside construction, I would like to first mention the necessity of securing an IT technology infrastructure. The biggest reason why IT technology infrastructure must be secured is to establish a root that can act in line with the changes and development speed of the future construction IT industry. I think trees with strong roots have the power to withstand any changes. In order for lakeside construction to grow in line with the changing construction IT market, I think it is the direction to prepare for the future market and to establish basic IT infrastructure by securing development experts and original technologies for construction IT convergence. ""I am a developer with '○○'."" As I have grown as a developer, I have come to have a tenet of becoming a responsible developer. Among the many competencies that I must possess as a developer, I chose 'responsibility' because I think it is what I need the most no matter what I perform. During my start-up activities, I learned related technologies for 14 hours a day to learn Android technologies that I did not know well for app development. As a result, I showed a sense of responsibility to complete the development within the target time. In order to complete a task within a given time, I have grown up with a principle of becoming a responsible developer because I need to learn skills by performing additional tasks as needed and returning my own time."
"""We want to become a necessary root for the growth of LDCC."" Based on my experience and competence in internal and external activities that I participated in during my college life, I applied to become a root that contributes to the development of LDCC's production system. LDCC's differentiated system construction project, which integrally builds an optimal system suitable for various corporate environments, was an opportunity to apply for the job at LDCC. If I join LDCC, which is leading the SI industry, I am confident that it will be a root that contributes to the growth of LDCC based on various internal and external activity capabilities experienced during my college life. In addition, based on my experience in competitions, start-ups, and internship activities, I want to quickly learn the skills necessary for work and show results to become a root for LDCC growth. ""I am a developer with '○○'."" As I have grown as a developer, I have a tenet to become a responsible developer. Among the many competencies that I must have as a developer, I chose 'responsibility' because I think it is what I need most no matter what I perform. During my startup activities, I learned related skills for 14 hours a day to learn Android skills that I do not know well for app development. As a result, he showed a sense of responsibility to complete the development within the target time. In order to complete such tasks within the given time, it is necessary to perform additional tasks as needed and return his or her own time to learn skills, so he has grown with the principle of becoming a responsible developer. ""I will be a developer who catches data."" We will develop Lotte Group's continuous revenue solution by utilizing 46 integrated member information data in 4 fields generated by L.POINT. First, we will learn and learn big data analysis technologies such as Hadoop and R for statistical analysis for processing large amounts of data for 3 years after joining the company. Based on the technology, we will build a customized Lotte curation service through information integration and pattern analysis of the consumption and behavior patterns of Lotte Group members and external factors (weather, transportation) Open API. We will more than double the operating efficiency and operating profit by recommending the products of each affiliate according to our pattern. Through this, we will make all of Lotte's customers become VIP customers. If LDCC's technology and passion for developing my Big Data platform are added to the construction of Lotte Curation Service, I am confident that we will be able to make a first-class voyage that can catch hidden values in data within 10 years."
"I took a subject called Basic Creative Engineering Design during the undergraduate class of ""The IOT World Made with Samsung Electronics"". I made a presentation with the topic of research on future industries and was new to IOT. As a result of the research, I found out that it is a great promising technology for the future and that big foreign companies such as MS and SISCO are already investing a lot. As I got to know about IOT, I became more and more interested and dreamed of making a world where people can stay convenient by using IOT technology. Samsung Electronics has formed an IOT commercialization team to prepare for the upcoming IOT era. It is dominating the IOT platform market by developing ARTIK, an IOT platform with security solutions and cloud functions. With ARTIK, I think it will be able to quickly and easily commercialize IOT devices and expand its influence in the IOT platform market in the future to use Thales' sophisticated security solutions that solve the current weak security problems of IOT devices. I applied to achieve my dream of creating a convenient world by using Samsung Electronics' advanced IOT technology. In order to achieve my dream at Samsung Electronics, I will try to acquire advanced IOT technology early on. And in the long run, I will contribute to the global use of the ARTIC platform by optimizing the IOT platform technology. After discharging from the military, I served in a restaurant and worked part-time as a barista for two years. I didn't have any experience working part-time before, so I didn't get used to my job and made many mistakes. I thought about whether serving was inappropriate for me and wondered if I should find another job. One day, while I was thinking about it, when I made a mistake, the restaurant owner told me, ""It's okay. Everyone makes mistakes. No one is good from the beginning. Try hard."" Listening to the boss, I was able to get rid of the guilt of making a mistake, and I thought to give up and try hard. As time passed, I became better at serving and reduced a lot of mistakes. And I was able to become a barista as a dessert business skillfully. Among the part-timers I worked with, when I became the best, I was recognized by the boss and asked him to be the manager who manages the restaurant part-timers. Since then, I have decided to live my life in the future with the motto, 'Don't give up on anything and do your best.' And when it was time to return to school, I quit my part-time job at a restaurant and went to school. While attending, I studied my major hard, and I had the opportunity to participate in a contest. It was a project competition on the theme of IOT at an embedded research institute in the school, and I teamed up with my friends to participate. The detailed topic was 'Autonomous Driving of Electric Bicycles'. It was a project that autonomously maintained through Arduino signals by measuring the distance between bicycles with a mobile phone GPS when platooning of electric bicycles. A problem occurred while I was developing Arduino, who was in charge of the speed control part of the electric bicycle. I tried to adjust the speed value using the software of the electric bicycle, but there was a problem that the value could not be changed in real time due to compatibility problems between Arduino and the electric bicycle software. I thought a lot about solving the problem, but I came to the conclusion that it was difficult to solve it with the knowledge and technology I knew. However, if I couldn't implement the speed control function, I couldn't proceed with the project. Reflecting on my motto, 'Don't give up on anything and do your best,' I have tried various things that can be done outside the level of knowledge I know. I contacted the company of the electric bicycle I bought and tried to get information about the electronics and circuit diagrams of the electric bicycle. By analyzing the electronic circuit diagram and sending signals to the throttle and brake control part of the electric bicycle directly with Arduino, I was able to successfully control the speed of the electric bicycle and finish the project. Taking this experience as a springboard, I will try to find a way to solve any problems in my life without giving up. This capability will be the foundation for not giving up when faced with a problem after joining the company. ""Development of Self-Driving and Challenges to Solve"" In the era of the 4th Industrial Revolution, self-driving cars are becoming a hot topic. Overseas, automakers such as Apple, Tesla, and BMW are investing a lot to make self-driving cars. Also, domestic automakers such as Hyundai Motor are also investing a lot, and IT company Naver will also develop Level 3 autonomous cars and show them at the 2017 Seoul Motor Show. When commercialized according to the development of self-driving cars, there are several advantages. Many human-caused accidents such as drunk driving and signal violations can be prevented. And if self-driving is used for commuting or long-distance travel, it will make people's lives convenient, as it can reduce driver fatigue and make the time spent driving cars useful. Although there are such advantages of self-driving cars, there are still challenges to be solved. First, it is necessary to systematically set laws and regulations for self-driving cars. For example, if an accident occurs while using partial self-driving cars, it is necessary to systematically divide the responsibilities between the driver and the self-driving car company. Second, there is an ethical issue. In an autonomous vehicle, the judgment on driving is determined by the algorithm of a computer program or artificial intelligence. However, there is a problem when an unavoidable accident occurs with pedestrians while driving autonomously. Self-driving cars will have to choose whether to prioritize the safety of pedestrians or passengers over pedestrian safety.And in the event of such an accident, who is responsible will also be a problem. With the development of autonomous driving technology, there are many advantages that make life convenient, but there are challenges that need to be solved accordingly. We will have to quickly solve the challenges we are facing in order to create a more convenient society."
"[I tied the strings to my sneakers. I'm ready to run] I'm a cheetah. Just like a cheetah who rushes to snatch prey as soon as it's ready, once it's set, I accomplish my goal with all my might. Through this, I was able to obtain job-related certificates such as information processing technician and CCNA at once. In addition, when I was working on my team project, I was able to complete it in a given period of time through mutual cooperation. However, some people say that I'm cautious or persistent because I always focus on the present. To supplement this, I open up various possibilities and make plans and seek alternatives. In addition, when working on a team project, I listen to various opinions of my team members and try to proceed in a way that everyone agrees with. [Challenge Spirit and Passion Learned through Sports] When I have a given goal, I have the passion to challenge myself in a more serious manner than anyone else. This persistent attitude started out due to sports climbing that my father started. I started as an artificial rock wall and traveled to many places, including Insubong's natural rock wall, to climb the mountain. Sports climbing is a dangerous sport that stimulates the desire to compete with oneself. If there is someone who is ahead of you, you must have a bilay from below to climb the rock wall safely. That is why the person who holds the line from below can also be responsible and not focused, which can lead to a big accident. On the other hand, when climbing, you cannot reach the top unless you go up with perseverance and effort. This hobby of sports climbing has made me more responsible in relationships with others, and has the grit and perseverance to challenge myself without giving up on everything. [I will be a reliable shield] I will become a security controller who can safely defend against intrusion attacks in a situation where major corporate confidential and personal information is leaked, and customer damage is growing. I will become a team member who can build trust in customers and NIT services by becoming a shield that is strengthened by the window that attacks without stepping back while facing various situations after joining the company. When I was in college, I started working as an office worker at an academy. However, as rumors spread that he was good at fixing computers, he was asked to deal with problems in general. Rather than complaining, I thought it was a good opportunity to gain knowledge by dealing with various obstacles to the computer system, and I was able to expand my computer knowledge by dealing with problems ranging from hardware and software. Based on this experience, I will contribute to becoming a reliable company by enhancing my ability to adapt to the ever-changing environment even after joining the NIT Service. [I will grow into a professional security controller in the NIT Service Security Control Team.] Within one year after joining the company, the NIT Service Security Control Team will quickly adapt to the security control work and the environment so that I can create synergy through sincere communication and collaboration with others. Within five years after joining the company, I will strengthen my practical skills to increase the efficiency of my work as the security control project leader. System security and network security are the most important and fundamental in control, so I will prepare CISSP to check my current capabilities and make up for what I missed. Within 10 years of joining the company, I will give more educational opportunities through the experience and knowledge gained in practice to develop the expertise of the members of the security control team, and I will show myself taking the initiative in self-development. In addition, I will become a PM with expertise to implement the best solutions and solutions to the customer."
"I have the experience of developing an unmanned parking system for beginner drivers. I became interested in developing software because I felt a sense of accomplishment by implementing the functions I wanted and checking them with my own eyes. Through this, I learned the importance of 'customer orientation' and I think it is consistent with CJ Olive Networks' direction, which puts customers first. I think CJ Olive Networks, which realizes customer value in various fields, is the most suitable for improving its customer-oriented capabilities. [Unmanned Parking System for Beginner Drivers] In the embedded computing system subject, a project was carried out using EV3 automobile robots. He always drives well, but the image of his mother calling his father because of the parking in the parking lot reminded me of 'unmanned parking'. First, we detected the parking line using the camera. Based on the location and number of the detected parking lines, we implemented a system that allows automatic parking by controlling the direction of the wheel motor. We also added a convenient function. When parking directly in the dark at night, it was difficult to park because the wheels were not visible. To relieve this inconvenience, LEDs were installed next to the wheels. In dark situations, the LED turns on automatically, and the wheels are visible, creating a convenient parking environment. I gained A+ credits and user-oriented importance by listening to the professor's praise for placing importance on the automation system and user convenience. CJ Olive Networks provides IT services both inside and outside the group through various business areas such as food, distribution, and entertainment. Depending on the characteristics of the customer industry, we provide 'integrated management customized services' to promote customer innovation, create new business opportunities, and put customers first. I think the experience of creating a system for beginner drivers coincides with CJ Olive Networks' customer orientation. I applied to CJ Olive Networks because I wanted to realize customer value in various business areas based on synergy effects. The goal is to 'release services that I made myself and achieve results.' This is because I had done many projects when I was a undergraduate but had no experience in launching them myself. CJ Olive Networks SW users think of them as 'employees' and 'customers'. We will develop services for users by practicing the following growth roadmap. In the first year of joining the company, I will study the services of CJ Olive Networks. I will learn about the overall system by learning common service areas such as finance, HR, and mobile. In the third year, I will understand the work of CJ affiliates. We will improve the inconvenience of the system and support the work of the employees by developing a new internal system through biometric authentication. From the fifth year, we will apply new IT technologies. We will provide convenience to customers by intelligentizing all CJ systems by utilizing VR, AR, and artificial intelligence. We will take customer feedback and fix any shortcomings. I think the ability of 'communication' is important to achieve the goal. This is because we need to have a process of identifying and giving feedback on user needs to create user-oriented SW. I have experience in achieving my goal by listening to the opinions of my team members. The tennis club did not perform well in national competitions for several years. As the leader in charge of training, I thought the reason why I could not perform well was because of a problem with the training method. We had a meeting every day and set the goal of advancing to the finals, and changed the training method as follows. First, some of the team members were freshmen who had never played a real game. The training method, which was focused on basic skills, was changed to focus on the actual game to develop a sense of practice. Second, unlike the previous one where all the members applied the same training method, the training method was divided by level to make up for the shortcomings. As a result, my skills and teamwork improved, and I achieved a quarterfinal performance that exceeded my goal among 128 teams. After joining the company, I will develop customer-oriented SW with my team members by demonstrating my communication skills. The most meaningful example is the project experience that solved the problems of working mothers. This is because by developing a solution using the smart home system, a new IT technology, customer value was improved, and it led to the award. [Smart Home System for Working Moms] When I worked part-time at an academy, my main task was to ask and answer the phone whether the students arrived at the academy safely. Through this, I was able to understand the practical concerns of working mothers, and it was an opportunity to plan a smart home project that could keep the child safe at home alone, which is the biggest concern. As a development environment, C++ and JavaScript were used on Linux, and Android apps were created using Java. Among them, we built a web server and were in charge of post communication between Android and the web server. First, we constructed smart home devices for the safety of children in the house. We constructed gas valves, interphones, and air conditioners, and created a smartphone app called ""Please Take Care of a Working Mom"" so that working mothers can control these smart home devices with their smartphones. We also constructed them to do housework. By constructing refrigerators, fluorescent lamps, and distributor smart home devices, the role of working mothers who can pay attention to housework was highlighted. I, who will soon become a working father, also sympathized with the upcoming reality, so I was able to implement functions optimized for working mothers. Through this, we won the Excellence Award at the Embedded SW Competition and the Presidential Award at the In-school Graduation Work Competition with the sympathy of the judges. CJ Olive Networks is responding quickly to the needs of the market by developing new technologies that meet the latest IT trends. It operates smart systems equipped with automation functions such as smart factory integration platforms, smart logistics centers, and smart stores to improve service levels. I think smart home systems are another option. After joining the company, we will contribute to CJ Olive Networks' smart system by developing a 'smart home platform' that gives convenience and safety to customers through home monitoring."
"Samsung Electronics is focusing on products that enhance the usability and convenience of customers, such as smart TVs, smartphones, and Samsung Pay. In addition, through a lineup of products ranging from premium to entry-level, customers are broadening their choice, putting customer-oriented values first. I have experience in developing an 'unmanned parking' system for beginner drivers. I think this experience is consistent with Samsung Electronics' direction of putting customers first. [Development of an 'unmanned parking' system for beginner drivers] In the embedded computing system subject, a project was carried out using EV3 automobile robots. He always drives well, but I remembered his mother calling his father because of parking in the parking lot, so I chose the theme as 'unmanned parking'. First, we detected the parking line using a camera. Based on the location and number of parking lines detected, we implemented a system that allows automatic parking by controlling the direction of the wheel motor. I got A+ credit and user-oriented importance from the professor's glowing review of the importance of user convenience. I think the experience of developing a system for beginner drivers is consistent with Samsung Electronics' 'customer orientation'. After joining the company, I will develop a platform that uses Samsung products smartly by developing a system that facilitates connection with digital devices. This will give convenience to customers and help expand the Samsung IoT ecosystem. [Start of Communication] The values of life are 'Let's communicate.' These values were able to form from the beginning of elementary school. I served as the president when I was in the fourth grade. I began communicating with the teacher by giving her suggestions and complaints. The teacher took appropriate measures accordingly and conveyed her words to her friends as well. Through this, I was able to create a good atmosphere in my class and finish the school year safely. Based on these experiences, I learned the importance of communication, and I was able to improve my communication skills even further by serving as the chairman in the fifth, sixth grade, and middle school. [8/128 Results Sharing the Goals] In 2014, I achieved better results by demonstrating the power of communication that I formed when I was young. The tennis club did not perform well in national competitions for several years. As the leader in charge of training, I thought that the reason why I was not able to perform well was a problem with the training method. We had a daily meeting and set the goal of advancing to the finals, and changed the training method as follows. First, some of the team members were freshmen who had never played a real game. The training method, which was focused on basic skills, was changed to focus on the actual game to develop a sense of practice. Second, we conducted the survey by asking each team member about his or her deficiencies. Unlike the past, where all the team members used the same training method, the training method was divided by level to make up for the deficiencies. As a result, my skills and teamwork improved, and I scored eight out of 128 teams that exceeded my goal. [Performance of 1/22 through communication] In 2015, I had an experience of breaking through the competition ratio of 22:1 through communication. I participated in the LG Global Challenger Competition by forming a team with friends from the IT, electrical and electronic departments, and industrial engineering departments. However, I had difficulty in deciding on a topic because my interests were different due to different majors. I tried to decide on a topic in the following way. First, we had a daily meeting. We came to topics that matched everyone's major and shared opinions on which was practical and objective. We also listened to their opinions. Rather than deciding by myself as a leader, I set a common goal by listening to the opinions of my team members. Motivated by this, I came up with more ideas. Through this, I was able to decide on the theme of 'Asia Power Network through HVDC', which covers everyone's major. Several majors gathered to approach the topic from various perspectives. Based on the synergy effect, they prepared a practical and objective story, and passed the document screening through the competition ratio of 22:1. [Life of Communication] Based on these experiences, I think the definition of communication is 'two-way traffic'. I was able to achieve good results because of the good free speech and listening among my team members. After joining the company, Samsung Electronics will show good results not only through customer stories but also through communication with internal employees, Samsung Group affiliates, and related technology companies. The centerpiece of the CES in 2015 and 2016 was the IoT. In addition, the scale of IoT is increasing as the domestic IoT market is expected to reach KRW 17 trillion in 2020. As such, I think the growth of IoT is due to the interest of non-professionals and experts. [Smart Home System Development] Based on the interest in IoT, I have experience in developing smart home systems as graduation works. We implemented various smart home devices such as air conditioners, gas valves, lights, and refrigerators. We implemented smartphone apps to remotely control these smart home devices and increased the degree of completion, winning the Excellence Award at the Embedded SW Competition. As such, the IoT field has become an area that not only experts but also non-professionals can easily access. Due to the low entry barrier to implementing technology, I think that interest and technology in IoT will improve. [Tizen of Open Strategy] Samsung also aims to expand the IoT ecosystem by utilizing Tizen. Samsung announced its open IoT strategy. It plans to create an era centered on Atik, IoT.js, and Tizen, and opened Tizen so that anyone can use it freely for free. I think this open strategy is a way to further activate Tizen. I have experience in various training sessions through Raspberry Pi. Raspberry Pi OS with Linux platform, open source 'Raspian' was a target without any difficulties. Whenever I didn't know or got stuck, I searched the internet and I was able to fix the problem by referring to posts with similar symptoms in different communities. Tizen would do the same.People interested in Tizen will gather to create a community, solve problems through communication and collaboration, and become a solid Tizen. Samsung will also be able to lead the IoT market by using Tizen, which has improved technology. I think it will be in the near future that all products using Tizen will be connected to IoT in 2020."
"I usually shop at department stores. However, as the world has become more digital and smart, it has become an era in which many people shop online. In the process, I was not happy with the tendency to buy high-quality, long-lasting products even if I bought one. However, Lotte was one company that clearly solved the problem in the middle. When I first accessed Lotte, the phrase ""department store"" first caught my eye. Literally, I had to shop directly at the department store, but it was comfortable to shop anytime, anywhere on my computer or smartphone. I want to make Lotte, which is precious to me, more convenient to people in the world and bring many benefits. ""The process based on integrity."" I was raised with the assumption that people should always be sincere. I used to attend classes after graduating from elementary, middle, and high schools, which are not much different from others, but among them, I can express that I am different from others and I can be proud of my superiority. Always faithful to the basic concept of time, and working in a sincere attitude anywhere, I have always had a reputation that is more than normal when I take classes in college, meet with basic people, or make promises. I also want to contribute to making Lotte a sincere company. As a newbie to ""Creativity in the Lab"", I have no experience in working in society, but while attending university, I entered a lab in return for the good wishes of my professor and served as an undergraduate research student. I helped and learned the research tasks of the graduate school seniors, and while watching the professor's research tasks from the side, I was in charge of the parts I could do and submitted works to various competitions. In the process, I was able to think more creatively by not just recognizing research as a task, but also working hard to use the results of the research in various fields, such as applying for a patent application."
"Growing up with the value of 'Let's do our best to the end', my biggest strength has become persistence. I felt that my skills improved and my confidence increased through the effort to review what I learned and devise new ways if there was a problem I didn't know because I liked math when I was a child. I knew that if I tried without giving up in this process, the sense of accomplishment would double, and I have believed that even if something difficult happens in my life, there must be a breakthrough. Sometimes this personality can be a disadvantage, but I think giving up before trying is missing another opportunity. I think it takes constant effort to maintain relationships between people. I have always tried to keep in touch first, feeling that if I keep in touch without contacting him because I am close to him, I can understand him. As a result, I have made friends and acquaintances who have been with him for a long time, and there are many precious people around me who can share memories. The company thinks that people and people come together to work for people. Moreover, IT companies think that people are property, and the relationship between people is the most important thing within them. I will work with the idea that the company does not just make money, but as a partner to meet people and achieve goals together. In the second semester of last year's fourth grade, I carried out a graduation project under the theme of improving the performance of the patent search system. However, I couldn't concentrate on the graduation project because the schedule overlapped with the final project of external education. As a result, all three items were evaluated as ""low"" in the interim evaluation, and the professor in charge recommended me to try again next semester. However, my team members and I analyzed the cause of the failure because we thought it would be regrettable if we gave up without trying properly. And if the means for the existing meeting were by messenger or phone, this time we met our team members in person and shared opinions. One of the reasons for the failure of the existing project was to make up for the difficulty of properly conveying each other's opinions through the wrong communication method. I received an A+ grade because I received ""awards"" in all the final evaluation and received first place among the seven teams. In fact, when I received a criticism in the interim evaluation, I would have received another ""low"" grade if I applied the wrong method and continued on because I lacked time. As I finished the graduation project, I gained confidence that I could achieve good results if I never gave up to achieve my goals in any crisis situation and performed my work carefully and accurately with flexible thinking. I took classes in various fields such as software, semiconductor, image processing, and communication in my department classes. I thought that the essential competency in all these fields was programming skills, and I gained basic knowledge by taking C, C++, data structure, and web programming classes. I felt the need for database knowledge in system development, so I took a database design course and learned how to collect, store, and utilize necessary data."
"I have enjoyed making things since I was young. My grandmother used to hold my hand every day and buy me a small prefabricated robot at a stationery store in front of elementary school, but when I matched it, I made it so focused that the day went by. Before I knew it, I was a little away from such assembly toys, and drivers and soldering were in my hand. One hobby has become to disassemble and assemble broken radios, speakers, toys, etc. at home, operate by a certain principle, and find the cause of the failure. I think that my concentration and analysis skills that have been established since I was young are the result of finding errors in the source code or being able to sit in one place for a long time. I think that if you don't do what you're given, you'll be harmed by others or you'll become lazy. So my job is to try to do it to the end. When I get stuck in the middle of the process, I try to find another way to solve the problem and avoid harming others. This is my strength, so I try to keep my promise to others, and I try to do my best to get the work I'm given to. My Trip Map started with the idea that it would be nice to see where and what photos were taken on a map while traveling. With the development of smartphones, it has replaced the role of digital cameras and film cameras. We took advantage of this to collect location information based on the metadata of photos taken from our smartphones so that we could create marks and display photos on a map. Furthermore, we created a bulletin board so that users could share travel information with each other. While working on the project, there were some conflicts due to disagreements, but each time I tried to solve them with new ideas. It was a great opportunity to experience all roles, including creating user UI pages and connecting to the database. What I always have in my heart is ""Let's be professional."" The position of ""professional"" that should not be satisfied with a hobby or favorite job requires a great sense of responsibility. I want to become a professional in software development. Recently, through an academy on campus, we reorganized what we lacked in JAVA and databases. I learned how to create user forms using Swing and access Oracle databases using OJDBC. Furthermore, it was an opportunity to make myself more advanced by challenging new things by learning how to develop a web using HTML and JavaScript that I am new to."
"""Good Dexterity Bad Boy"" I've always loved making things since I was a child. My grandmother used to hold my hand and buy me a small prefabricated robot at a stationery store in front of elementary school every day, but when I matched it, I made it so focused that the day went by. Before I knew it, I was a little away from such an assembly toy, and finally I had a screwdriver and a solder in my hand. It has become a hobby to disassemble and assemble broken radios, speakers, toys, etc. at home, operate by a certain principle, and find the cause of the failure. I think that my ability to concentrate and analyze from an early age is the result of being able to find errors in source code or sit in one place for a long time. It will help the project progress by finding errors that others cannot see, and reducing the time to analyze and understand algorithms. ""Water droplet consistency penetrates rocks."" When I was a child, my father told me to do my job on my own. He said that if I didn't do what was given to me, I would be harmed by others or I would be lazy. So, from an early age, I have a personality that tries to do everything I do. When I get stuck in the middle of work, I try to find a different way and solve the problem, and I don't want to hurt others. This has become my strength, so I try to keep my promise to others, and I try my best to finish what is given to me. ""If you give up, you can't dream."" When I first started college, I was ashamed of myself for falling behind students who had learned in IT since high school, and after I was discharged from the military, I had a lot of fear of returning to school. However, since I decided to return to school because I couldn't give up my interest in IT, I focused on studying so that I wouldn't fall behind other students. When I was in second grade, I created a delivery food app for my school area and dreamed about my job as a software developer. It was a meaningful time to learn about harmony among my team members and the preparation process of the project while making a gym management program with them in third grade. In fourth grade, I received an overall education on Java through a security developer course based on a core structure that can be used directly in the practice implemented by the Hanbit Education Center to acquire insufficient programming knowledge, which gave me an opportunity to grow to the next level. When I first created the delivery app as a ""Result of Interest and Pride"" team project, it was amazing that students were interested in it. The more I became interested, the more I became attached and proud, and I decided to become a software developer. So I read, coded, and practiced software-related books and programming-related books in the library every day. With this consistency, I want to go on the path of a developer to fill in the gaps. In the book called ""The 10,000 Hour Law,"" if you work hard for a total of 10 years, you become an expert in a field. I want to be recognized as an expert and become a developer who can be helpful to someone."
""" To Infinity and Beyond "" In the first semester of my fourth year, I developed ""OOO,"" an application for lending and selling books, as a graduation project. I organized my home screen with the Tab, which I used to use comfortably, but I suffered from various errors due to the compatibility of textbooks and Android Studio versions, and the Tab's strictness, which slightly changed the composition of each version. In fact, even if it wasn't implemented properly, it was enough to just look at the process and solve it because it was a graduation project, but my team worked hard, had a meeting, decided to implement it in Button rather than Tab, and developed the application and enrolled in the Play Store. Some people say, ""Don't let it work,"" but sometimes I realized that it was important to find a solution in a different way than what you chose. As someone who is still in the process of learning, experiencing that you can do it in one way and another was an opportunity to realize the meaning of ""beyond my limits."" Like Buzz's famous line, he chanted ""To Infinity and Beyond."" "" A Person With Something in His Heart ""I happened to see an interview with a researcher at TmaxSoft while searching the Internet. Among the many contents in particular, the phrase ""bringing out something in your heart to TmaxSoft's soul"" is the most memorable. I grew up in an environment where I was not rich in materials, so I was used to enduring with many emotions and what I wanted to do for my parents and family in my heart from an early age. However, the attitude of the pure heart that I had at an early age has changed to the attitude of trying hard for anything now. Rather than being greedy for what I want, I have been able to devote my passion and efforts to do my best from what is currently given to me and what I have. I want to do my best to complete what I have in my heart with TmaxSoft through education. Rather than staying in place in a competitive landscape, I will contribute to the development of TmaxSoft by becoming a member who is thirsty for growth and development."
"I think it is consistent with the direction of the IBK system, which puts customers first. I have experience in working on projects to solve problems while listening to customers' concerns. By implementing new IT technologies and services that reflect reality, I was able to lead to the award. When I was working part-time at the cram school, my main task was to answer the phone to see if the students arrived at the academy safely. Through this, I was able to understand the practical concerns of working mothers, and I developed a 'Smart Home for Working Moms' project that can keep the safety of a child who is alone at home. As a result, I won the Excellence Award in the Embedded SW Competition by developing services that meet customer and market needs. I think the direction is the same with me in that I value customers the most. The demand for the credit system will increase in the future as competition in the mid-interest loan market increases. I applied because I wanted to become a new employee who puts the happiness of customers first based on the credit system, which is the strength of the IBK system. I have experience of earning A+ grades while receiving perfect scores in the project through creative ideas. In the subject of the embedded computing system, I proceeded with the project using EV3, an automobile robot. Although he drives well, I chose ""unmanned parking"" as I remembered his mother calling his father because of parking in front of my house. It not only implemented the unmanned parking system but also implemented creative functions. I think creative is the ""shortcut to relieve the inconvenience."" In fact, when I parked directly in the dark at night, it was difficult to park because I couldn't see wheels. In order to solve this inconvenience, we installed LEDs next to wheels to create a convenient parking environment in which wheels are visible even in dark situations. By implementing a differentiated system based on creative ideas, I received a perfect score on the project, laying the foundation for a perfect A+ grade. After joining the company, I will develop a computer system that relieves customer inconvenience through creative ideas and become a new employee of A+. Accepting others' opinions, I scored in the quarterfinals for the first time ever. The tennis club did not perform well in national competitions for several years. We thought that the reason why we could not perform well was because of a problem with the training method, so we had a meeting and discussed the training method. However, there was a conflict between the two opinions, which is the 'actual battle-oriented training method' including myself, and another opinion, the 'basic skills first'. As the head of the training department, I accepted both opinions and changed the training method as follows. First, I added time to conduct customized training on a one-on-one basis with my seniors. Based on this, I filled in the parts that I lacked in basic skills. Second, I developed my sense of practice by playing actual games with various opponents. My skills have improved by learning basic skills and practical skills. As a result, I achieved the quarterfinals for the first time ever in a competition involving 128 teams. I have grown by 'communicating' since I was in elementary school. As the chairman of the 4th grade, I informed the teacher about my friends' suggestions and complaints. The teacher took appropriate measures accordingly, and based on this, I was able to lead to a good atmosphere in the classroom. I further improved my communication skills by serving as the chairman in the 5th and 6th grades. I participated in the OOO OOO OOO in 2015 and demonstrated my communication power. Due to my different majors from my team members, I had difficulty deciding on a topic because I had different interests. I was able to choose a topic that I could share with everyone through a week-long meeting while listening to my team members. I was able to pass the document screening by choosing a practical topic and breaking the competition ratio of 22:1. I think communication is an ""achievement."" Good communication has resulted in good results. My goal is to live a life of communication with others. After joining the company, I will show good results through stories from colleagues, related technology companies, and customers."
"I have grown by 'communicating' since I was in elementary school. When I was in 4th grade, I was the chairman and told my teachers about my friends' suggestions and complaints. The teacher took appropriate measures accordingly, and based on this, I was able to lead a good class atmosphere. I also served as the chairman in the 5th and 6th grades and further improved my communication skills. I participated in the OOOOOO competition in 2015 and showed my communication power. Due to my team members and other majors, I had difficulty choosing a topic because the fields of interest were different. I was able to select a topic that could harmonize with everyone's majors through a week-long meeting while listening to the team members. By choosing a practical topic, I was able to pass the document screening by breaking through a competition ratio of 22:1. I think the definition of communication is 'two-way traffic'. It has produced good results because of the good free speech and listening among the team members. I think Hyundai I'Park Mall also needs to communicate. If we have achieved good results by understanding the needs of customers and launching services for customers, I think both-way traffic with customers has been successful. After joining the company, we will show good results not only through customers, but also through communication with internal employees and related technology companies. My strength is 'friendliness'. I like to communicate with people because I am an extrovert. I have a personality that smiles a lot, so I was able to open my heart easily and get close to people quickly. Through this, I get to know my seniors, juniors, and colleagues, and I am imprinted as a fun and comfortable senior to my juniors. In addition, I was able to get a lot of service by being close to the owners of restaurants around the university and the ladies of the store. Based on this outgoing personality, I was able to develop my ability to empathize with the generation by listening to the words 'slick'. The downside is that I am meticulous in my daily life, and I tend to be unsatisfied with my work if I don't do it perfectly when I work. Due to the nature of the engineering department, which has many assignments for each subject, when a single assignment is completed completely, I submitted many other assignments without completing them as the deadline was numbered. To overcome these shortcomings, I prioritized my work and proceeded with what I could do quickly. By completing all the assignments and projects in all subjects, I was able to supplement my shortcomings by winning three scholarships. I will become a new employee who saves the strengths, complements the weaknesses, and demonstrates my abilities in the Hyundai I'Park Mall. I learned about the importance of 'advice' through the failure of the "" 1/3 failure"" contest. I participated in the OOOOOO in 2015. I passed the document screening, which was a competition ratio of 22:1, and I was ahead of the interview screening. However, since it was my first time attending the contest, I prepared for the interview only with my team members despite having no interview experience. I practiced without advice and advice from professors with a lot of knowledge and experience in their major, and senior citizens who had already succeeded in the contest. Because of the lack of this process, I was unable to grasp the strengths and weaknesses of the team, so I was inevitably less competitive than other teams. As a result, I failed the interview screening, which was a competition ratio of 3:1. ""Success of the award"" and ""Advice"" was engraved on it, which led to my victory. I worked on my graduation work in 2016. I had a meeting with the professor every week to discuss the team's direction. I could get advice on technical shortcomings and practical aspects. After the meeting, I was able to improve my completeness in terms of technical and practicality by correcting the shortcomings with my team members. As a result, I won the Excellence Award at the Embedded SW Competition and the President Award at the On-Campus Graduation Competition. I think the experience of working on a project to understand and solve customer concerns is consistent with the direction of Hyundai I'Park Mall, which puts customers first. When I was working part-time at the cram school, my main task was to answer the phone to ask whether the students arrived at the academy safely. Through this, I was able to understand the practical concerns of working mothers, and I developed a 'Smart Home for Working Moms' project that can keep the safety of a child who is alone at home, which is the biggest concern. As a result, we won the Excellence Award at the Embedded SW Competition by developing services that meet customer and market needs. I think this experience is consistent with the goal of Hyundai I'Park Mall to maximize customer value. I think the customers of the Hyundai I'Park Mall IT system are 'internal employees' and 'real customers'. After joining the company, I will maximize the value of my customers by practicing the following growth roadmap. In the first year of joining the company, I will help employees with their work. I will understand the overall system and immediately reflect the improvements to support efficient work. In the third year of joining the company, I will implement convenient customized services for customers. By developing an integrated membership service, we will increase customer loyalty and contribute to the happiness of our customers. Through cooperation with ""8/128 Success in Sharing Goals,"" I have achieved the quarterfinals for the first time ever. When there is a difficult time after joining the company, I will work with my team members to identify the cause and overcome the problem. When I was working in a tennis club, I did not have good results in the 'National Tennis Club Competition' for several years. Ahead of the competition, my members' confidence was lowered and I tried to put meaning into participation without a goal. As the guidance manager in charge of training, I thought the reason why I could not achieve good results was a problem with the training method. I had a weekly meeting with my club members to set my goal of advancing to the finals, and through feedback, I changed my training method as follows. First, it is 'experience'. With the existing training method, which focused on basic learning, it was not possible to develop a sense of practice. Therefore, as part of the training, we prepared for the actual competition by playing actual games with various opponents, and after the end of the competition, we spared no advice through feedback. Second, it is 'eye-level education.' Unlike the previous practice in which all the members applied the same training method, we divided the training method by level to make up for the shortcomings. In addition, we invited juniors who lacked skills and conducted customized training with seniors.He taught senior citizens' know-how and encouraged them to build their confidence. Lastly, it is 'voluntary.' I changed the training date from two weeks ago to three times a week one month ago. I thought consistency was more important than cramming. In addition, they were encouraged to participate three times a week on their own, thereby developing autonomy and responsibility. As a result, their skills and teamwork improved, and they were able to achieve the quarterfinals for the first time ever in a competition involving 128 university teams. Through this, I was able to feel the importance of cooperation. I will demonstrate these capabilities in the Hyundai I'Park Mall, where teamwork is important. After joining the company, I will join with my team members to find a solution when the result is not good or when there is something difficult to solve."
"I applied because I usually like Samsung products and experience its strong H/W and S/W, and wanted to develop S/W that was developed someday. I was very impressed that IT technology can be used as convergence with various products through presentations on Samsung's work environment since I was in college. As a result, I became interested in software development itself, and this aspiration became even hotter as I worked on several projects. I have such a dream that my S/W is received well among users and my image of Samsung is also positively reconsidered. I hope this recruitment will be a big step to grow after joining the company as an S/W developer of Samsung, and I hope that it will improve my mutual exchange and production skills when I participate in company projects. Computer lectures I learned in elementary school were very attractive in that I could handle everything with just the letters on the screen. I was not just attracted to it, but I dug deeper and obtained a word processor certificate. After that, I entered university with a faint dream after going through middle and high school, and even before I joined the military, I only thought vaguely about the future. I just studied my major with the thought that if I were good at school, I would be able to make it after graduation. Of course, I had no goals for what I would do in the future. However, the military gave me a break in my thoughts and at the same time allowed me to develop my hopes for the future. While studying TOEIC, I had the belief that I should be more enterprising while reading books in the library. At the same time, I became interested in design and began to create personal works. Furthermore, I transferred to computer engineering after discharge because I wanted to acquire engineering knowledge in accordance with the era of academic convergence. Without the military, I would have wandered without a future. Even though it was a long time of two years, I am grateful for helping me become a turning point in my life. After discharge, I studied harder and actively asked questions from my professor so that I could not find out what I did not know, and received a scholarship throughout the school year. I obtained certificates for computer graphics, web design, and information processing in order to know knowledge that I did not learn in school. I was interested in Japanese other than English, so I studied by myself and obtained JLPT N2. I also worked part-time on weekends at the city library for a year after I was discharged from the military as a library manager, and I learned how to respond to customers and think from customers' perspectives. For the past three years, I also worked as a hobby while producing album covers, gradually receiving orders from other musicians. Furthermore, I was able to develop speech expressing thoughts by joining a book club and participating in related events, and thanks to these efforts, I was able to go on a cultural tour in Spain with the support of the school when I graduated. Here is Samsung Electronics, which has been developing dreams through this process and will finally make them come true, right before me. As I have worked in an enterprising attitude without fear, I will become an employee who asks and learns more about it even after joining the company. ""Spreading the damage of ransomware and coping with it."" Ransomware, which has emerged since the 2010s, is growing into a dangerous virus all over the world. Korea is also not safe, so it is spreading through domestic websites starting in 2015. Recently, even ransomware that attacks companies has appeared, so it cannot be overlooked any longer. The characteristic of this virus is that it encrypts all the file extensions of images, documents, etc., and does not release them unless a certain amount of money is paid, but it is not clear whether even this is really released. Some analysts say that all this money is used to fund terrorism, but it is not reliable in the first place. The only remedy is to find a key to decrypt the encrypted file, but the problem is that since there are many types of ransomware, the solution is a long way off unless the developer intentionally discloses the key. After all, once encrypted, you can either delete it or keep it until the key is released. Why is this virus especially rampant? The reason is simple: money. There are people who see this virus as a new way of doing business that can be difficult to decipher unless they find the key, and make tracking difficult by using payment methods such as bitcoin. How scary this is when ransomware has even appeared, which lures the victim as a bait to release it if she infects another PC? We want a more reliable response here. Backup is the best approach, but you need to come up with a plan that can be done in the first place. To do this, we need to come up with legislation that requires strong punishment for ransomware, limits the use of S/Ws that are vulnerable to security such as flash, and, above all, strong investigative cooperation between countries. Since ransomware spreads across countries, not just in certain countries, it is necessary to ensure smooth communication and common provisions between countries so that there is no disruption in investigation."
"""Childhood Dream"" When I was in elementary school, I saw students sitting in front of a computer and programming at a computer academy run by my father. With the combination of English and text messages, I became very curious about the actual programs being executed. I have been fascinated by the fact that I can make what I want and have dreamed of majoring in computers. ""The will to turn the tables on the exam"" As soon as I was discharged from the military after becoming a college student, my father retired, and during this period of time, I was engaged in academic, part-time job, and consumption activities. I had a lot of greed for academics and connections, but one day felt too short for me to do everything at the same time. However, I thought that this was not a difficulty but a stage for an examination, and I had a firm will to ""solve what I planned today by today."" I used my notebook to record my schedule and finished my plans step by step so that I would not fall behind. As a result, I was able to achieve satisfactory grades through my passion for my studies, and I was able to complete two internship activities, a scholarship, and an oo youth employment academy education. In addition, in 2014, I was able to successfully complete various events such as festivals and soccer competitions while serving as the vice chairman of So-im. By experiencing overcoming hardships, I came to have the conviction, ""Let's not lose our laughter under any circumstances, and overcome it with sincerity and effort."" This conviction will be the driving force for me to continue to develop as a person in the modern world. I think that taking care of something small that others cannot think of leaves a greater impression than giving an impression with a material gift to others. The advantage of being ""small"" is that I can distinguish myself from others. I worked in the military as an important human resources administrative officer. At this time, what I thought was the most important was to stay connected throughout the course of work. First, I analyzed the behaviors of the company commander, the administrative supply officer, and the senior officials at the office and what kind of work style I like, and based on the analysis, I took care of the small things from behind. For example, when a guest came, he would immediately turn on the coffee pot, set aside essential things for the task, and call them in advance so that they would not wait for the dispatched vehicle, to anticipate what would happen next time and help or unknowledge the tasks in advance. Thus, when I was discharged from the military, the executives in the same office would stop me from discharging, saying that life after my discharge was terrible. As such, it is important to take care of the trivial things that people around you may take for granted in advance. Just as I have worked hard for the convenience of those around me in the military, I will try to become an employee who thinks and acts in advance so that customers and executives do not experience any inconvenience even after entering the modern world. ""Scared"" I was a skittish young man. It was the fear that I could be eliminated from the ever-changing society's trends and technologies. It was this tendency that arose from majoring in IT, which was exceptionally sensitive to change and trends. But rather, this fear was the driving force that kept me running. Not to fall behind, I made the following efforts. First, I tried to have a firm domain about my major in computers. To this end, I took various major skills such as Database, Web System, and Embedded System in my undergraduate course. In addition, through the training of the o Employment Academy, a project called 'Between Musicals and Theater' was carried out under the theme of performance reservation service using the Spring Framework. Finally, in order to confirm my knowledge in my major, I had time to review my major I learned while obtaining an information processing technician license. Second, I tried to provide high-quality products through a QA (Qualification Guarantee) intern course of a company called o. While conducting QA on TrusZone, a network separation solution, I found bugs by conducting a Confirm Test and a Regression Test through TC. It wasn't just looking for bugs, it was trying to modify and manage TC according to the changed contents, and recommended it to the staff in charge to develop the product, and changed the program details. Of course, there were moments when this fear was more difficult and frustrating than others. However, I've tried without stopping to turn this fear into confidence. I developed CS Mind by experiencing a part-time job as an interviewer in the employment dimdol program conducted by oooo. In a two-day program with several booths at the Jangchung Gymnasium, I worked as an exit security guard and was in charge of bathroom guidance and human resources. When I was interviewing at several companies before, I thought that interviewers showed an image of the company, and based on that thought, I decided to give a good image to the interviewers. Also, the needs of the part-time employees were similar to what I thought, and I decided to satisfy the demands as much as possible. As the work began, I answered the interviewer's various questions with all my heart as much as possible, and prepared various refreshments to relieve tension. Also, when you leave, I tried to give you the most comfortable atmosphere by greeting with laughter. The person in charge of middle of work praised me for hiring a really good exit part-time job, and after the work was finished, I was asked if I could do it again. Afterwards, I was able to fully demonstrate my CS Mind skills by taking on an exit part-time job in a program held in Daejeon. Even after joining Hyundai Marine, we will become an employee who builds trust by forming intimacy with the people around us through laughter. ""With Free Riders as Partners"" Currently, university is experiencing problems due to free rides during group assignments. I also experienced this situation in team projects. It was when I was working on a team project in the creative engineering design course. We set and held meetings twice a week, and as the meetings progressed, one person began to show up as a free rider, often being late or not faithfully performing the shared roles.Eventually, there was a setback in the process, and the team members took over the role of free riders, and complaints about the uncooperative attitude of all team members began to grow. I thought about excluding this team member, but I thought that the team should be able to make up for each other's shortcomings, so I decided to stay together until the end. I thought that conversation was the only way to solve the heavy team atmosphere, so I had time to communicate. Through the company dinner, we talked about everyday things such as the team members' interests and hobbies. My friend was open-minded in a comfortable atmosphere, so he confessed his concerns that he could not understand the contents of the meeting due to lack of technology due to the first topic he was developing. I thought that the low participation rate was a problem for everyone who was not interested in the team members. This led me to learn the importance of communication in team projects. After that, I had regular communication time with my team members, and I was able to complete the project within the period through feedback between them. I will contribute my teamwork ability when conducting practical projects in the modern sea based on this experience. The sense of accomplishment that follows by challenging a new field from ""unfamiliar"" to ""familiar"" became an opportunity to increase my confidence. In my undergraduate years, I was unfamiliar with embedded systems because of the SW-oriented education curriculum. However, as an IT person, I felt the importance of experiencing various projects, so I took this as an opportunity and challenged the embedded system. The first emotion I felt while working on the input device project called ""Air Handle"" was ""unfamiliar"" itself. Rather than proceeding with the development at first, I tried to understand the circuit principle and sensor behavior of the Breadboard accurately. After that, I successfully completed the project by applying the algorithm I made on H/W, which was made based on the circuit principle that I have studied and implemented by converting the driver's handle motion into a range of values of gyro sensors. Watching the algorithm that was made after many trials and errors accurately control H/W, I felt proud. Following the unfamiliar first meeting between S/W and H/W, the challenge to embedded systems did not stop. It was to make unfamiliar challenges into familiar ones. We achieved new goals by completing projects such as ""smart RC cars"" equipped with automatic parking systems and remote control functions, and ""smart door locks"" that control doors from the outside. Based on this experience, I gained confidence that even if it is a challenge to an unfamiliar field, I can do it by constantly trying to familiarize myself with it, and that confidence will become a big weapon as an IT person. ""100% Persuasion for Change"" When I was an intern, I had a QA about TruthZone, a SW-HW fusion network separation solution. Once, I had to change the network test environment at the request of a customer. Although many changes were needed due to a large-scale change, there were many difficulties due to the lack of giving to network wires and equipment, perhaps due to the long-standing environment. Interns said that it was impossible to change everything, but I insisted that it should be changed 100%. He argued that it was not important because it does not seem important now, but for the convenience of our successor, he should change the whole thing while recording, and suggested two ways. 1. How to use the RackTables tool 2. How to give a physical cycle I thought that using this method would make it easier for someone other than us to change the environment in the future, and I succeeded in persuading my motives. I went back and forth to the server room, connected and canceled the line directly over the phone, and wrote the cycle and tool. As a result, we successfully built the test environment that the customer wanted. In addition, the environmental change that was requested later was also successful by referring to the tool and physical cycle. After the internship period was over, I was able to take over without difficulty through two things."
"[Have you ever taken death seriously?] ""When we found Jungwoo's remains, his lower body was gone."" This is what I heard in training class when I was nearing the end of the seven weeks of basic training courses in the marines. It was a vivid story of an officer who experienced the Yeonpyeong battle in person. As a trainee at the time, I thought that I could experience the same Marine Corps, the same field artillery. Without even thinking about death, the thought, 'If my life ends here, how will my life be evaluated?' became an opportunity to strengthen my strong will. Since then, I have lived a life like water flowing down. [I can do anything now. I'm not afraid] The experience of entering the abyss gave me the driving force to faithfully and enjoy everything in society. My major in computers was difficult enough to get A+ and A, and I got TOEIC OOO and TOEIC Speaking level O. In addition, I engaged in a number of activities during the two-year theater club, information security club activities, OO Electronics SST special internship selection group, and during the vacation, I took part in a number of activities during the year and a half after I was discharged from the military, including tutoring and mentoring in English. I have created opportunities for myself to remove my shyness, which used to be my weakness, and to build up social skills and diverse knowledge from all walks of life. [Korea Appraisal Board. The starting point of my life] I would like to emphasize that my sincere attitude and affection for the study that I have poured out for the past 15 years continues to this day. In addition, my goal is to become a person who can lead everyone by creating a good atmosphere and who I want to work with. And I would like to become one of the pillars of the Korea Appraisal Board, which contains my professional knowledge that I have honed in my head and my dedication to the development of the national economy."
"[Growing Up] I have a special 'passion' for my dream. At the computer academy my father ran, I saw students sitting in front of a computer and programming. With the letters on the screen, I became very curious about the actual programming. Since then, I have been attracted to programming and developed a dream of becoming a programmer. I always sat in the front row in class, answered the professor's questions actively, and asked questions confidently. As basic knowledge gradually accumulated, I studied with my juniors. I came running for my dream when I was young and I am ready to pour out my 'passion' once again. [Courtesy others if you want to grow up] These are the values of my life. This is the lesson of my high school, and I have been using it as a value since then. I didn't understand this from the beginning, but I tried to practice it as it is. First of all, I always started with a low attitude when I started learning. Even if it was something I knew, I actively participated in class and served the teachers in my mind, and I found myself developing according to the teacher's teaching. I also began to serve my friends. In order to fix my shortcomings through my friend's strengths, I served my friend and made many people naturally by overcoming my shortcomings. Since then, I have become a value in my life, and when I start a new job or meet people, I am not proud of myself, and I started from a low attitude serving a big person, and I always got good results. I also want to show myself to start with a low attitude and grow more and more at TmaxSoft. [Capacity] In order to create strengths in the IT field, I have prepared two competencies with passion. First, I was faithful as a computer major. Among the various competencies that members of S/W developer must have, I thought that the most important was the basic IT competency. Through my undergraduate program, I took various major skills that I thought were basic, such as Embedded System, Database, and C. Java. Through this, I developed a real-time parking management system using Java and Database and applied my major skills as development. In addition, through the DB Employment Academy training conducted by the Korea Database Development Institute, we completed training on Web, Java, and DB, and proceeded with a project called 'Between Musical and Theater' under the theme of performance reservation service. In order to confirm my knowledge of the major, I had time to review the major I learned while obtaining an information processing technology certificate. Second, in order to learn a practical sense, I worked on a QA intern at a company called AhnLab and developed my quality improvement ability. Working in the QA team of OO, we conducted S/W QA tests on TruthZone, a network separation solution, and wanted to provide high-quality services. Through testing, we directly found issues and managed and improved them by using a tool called BugTrack. In addition, we directly added, modified, and deleted TC (TestCase) on new issues and developed the ability to provide the highest quality software to customers. [Strong and Shortcomings] It was essential to serve in the military as an administrative soldier and handle various tasks due to the nature of my work. I was ordered to do many things, but as I relied only on my memory, I found my shortcomings that I sometimes forgot things. While thinking about how I could remember everything, I decided to write it down in a diary and prioritize it to get things done. As I handled things according to the priorities organized in this way, the accuracy of my work improved and the efficiency of my work increased. As a result, I was able to handle bigger tasks and gained expertise in my work. Prioritizing the records and records that I started to fix my shortcomings has gradually become a strength and part of my life. Even when I am engaged in various activities after discharge, I always keep a diary, record it, rank it, and manage my work efficiently, and manage time and work. I will record everything and show you how I grow with expertise in tasks to take on, learning and solving important tasks step by step. [Hobby Activities] I relieve stress mainly through sports activities. First, I control my stress by taking a 2:30-minute round trip by bicycle using the Han River. When I ride a bike along the Han River, the stuffy inside is relieved through the cool wind, and I manage my mind by thinking to myself. Bicycle riding is a way to relieve stress by making up for the inability to exercise due to many things and keeping the body and mind healthy. I also enjoy watching the baseball team that I have liked since I was young. Every year, I join as a paid member and have a sense of belonging and support to relieve stress. We discuss the results of the game with the same fans through SNS, and we are friends beyond the same club members who we met in an online club, and communicate with the same meaning. When I visit the stadium in person, I scream with my friends who went with me in one heart to build friendships and relieve stress through support. [Club Activity] Since I was a freshman in the university, I have belonged to the 'Farmers' group, a small group within the undergraduate school. Before joining the military, Somoim had many students due to active exchanges between seniors and juniors, and I did more activities than other Somoim. After returning to school after the military, the status of Somoim has changed a lot from before. Not only were there no exchanges between seniors and juniors, but the number of active students has decreased a lot. First, to recognize the problem, we independently held a countermeasure meeting between the motives. The problem was that there was less time to meet each other. In order to overcome the problem, I first contacted my seniors and juniors, and took some time to spread my argument even if we were busy. He argued, 'Many seniors helped us until we were here. We should give back to our juniors as much as we received from them!'The seniors and juniors thought the same thing and knew the problems, but were told that they were busy and had no leading people, so they couldn't put them into practice, so I decided to take the lead. In order to spend time with the juniors, I conducted the study in two ways: an academic section, a birthday party, and a picnic. As a result, it naturally converged between the seniors and juniors, and the honor of the past was restored. I was recognized for a lot of my achievements in that I began to revitalize So-im independently. I felt that anything could be accomplished by working with people with one mind and realized the importance of my colleagues. I also felt that any conflict situation could be resolved through meaningful dialogue. [Motivation for application and Aspiration after joining the company] I have attended the CES 2013 in Las Vegas, the United States. I have experienced new IT technologies from world-class companies at the world's largest electronics exhibition. The fact that IT technology can be applied to people's lives in such a variety of ways made my heart race. If I am not satisfied with my current performance and do not improve, I will lose my competitiveness over time and feel that I will be eliminated at the same time. TmaxSoft is not satisfied with its current solution, does not dwell on past failures, and is trying various challenges with the goal of localizing the operating system. I applied because I thought that TmaxSoft was like a company award. After joining the company, I will constantly work hard with the goal of surviving the global IT market that is more severe than pride and leading the IT industry. First of all, I will absorb the work of the department I will work in quickly and accurately. In addition, I will constantly understand and understand the trend of IT technology trends and incorporate new technologies into existing IT technologies so that I can become a talented person who strives and develops for better IT technologies. Finally, I want to make the products I made to make the hearts of another Korean IT student."
"People can experience new experiences and beginnings through transportation such as buses and airplanes, or experience a break-up. The high-quality service I received from the reservation system, the airport, and the cabin staff while using Asiana Airlines when traveling to the U.S. with excitement on my first overseas trip amplified the excitement I had. I think it is important to provide high-quality services so that people who start anew do not experience any inconvenience to sadness. Asiana IDT is striving to provide smooth IT services by providing services for customers and flight services for employees in transportation-related businesses such as aviation and buses. I felt human in Asiana IDT's business and was attracted to it. I applied because I wanted to create more added value and return the kindness I received from Asiana, which made me even more excited with the service I received, based on my major IT. After joining the company, I will try to survive in the harsh global IT market rather than settling down thinking that I have become one of the best companies. I think the first thing I have to do is to learn and understand my part. I will try to absorb the work quickly and accurately enough that I am proud to be the king of knowledge in my part. Also, since not all parts of the company can be achieved by the performance of the part alone, I will also understand the overall process within the company. Furthermore, I will have a long-term goal of understanding and familiarizing myself with the flow of new IT technology trends. I think that I can handle my tasks more efficiently when I have knowledge in various fields in the software market. I will try to become a talented person who can look forward to the future by providing better IT services by incorporating new technologies into existing IT services. In addition, I will develop my current information processing technician license into an information management technician license, and I will also achieve my own growth. I think that people who can apply to a wide range of fields by looking at the whole thing can grow bigger than those who are good in one field. In the system development and operation job of Asiana IDT, I supported the IT sector because I thought that I could build up my skills by looking deeply through various IT-related jobs. Among the various competencies that members of IT must have, I thought that the most important thing was the basic IT competency, so I wanted to have a firm domain for my major in computers. Through my undergraduate program, I took various major skills that I thought were basic, such as embedded systems, databases, and C. Java. In addition, through the DB Employment Academy training conducted by ****, I completed education on the web, Java, and DB, and conducted a project called 'Between Musicals and Theater' under the theme of performance reservation service. In order to confirm my knowledge of my major, I had time to review my major I learned while obtaining an information processing technician license. During my undergraduate years, I had a lot of fear about embedded systems that used a lot of H/W, but I felt the need for experience in various types of projects and challenged them. While working on a project called 'Air Handle', I studied to understand the circuit principles and sensor behavior of the Breadboard rather than recklessly developing it. After that, the algorithm was completed by converting the value of the gyro sensor, an algorithm that recognizes the driver's handle motion, which was the core point of the project, into a range. I successfully completed the project by applying the algorithm I created on top of H/W. Then, I never stopped the challenge to change the unfamiliarity with the embedded system into familiarity. I completed projects such as 'Smart RC Car' with automatic parking system, remote control function, and 'Smart Door Lock' that controls the door. Based on this experience, I gained the confidence that even if it is a challenge to an unfamiliar field, I can do it by constantly trying to make it familiar. At the time of my QA intern at a company called AhnLab, I was in charge of network separation solution. In the beginning, when things were not familiar with them, the work was not easy in a tight schedule. As the deadline for regular testing was approaching, there was one unexpected bug. In the process of repeating copy and paste as a joke, files that should not be moved became copied. Although I sensed that it was a major issue, I found a bug that was not in the Test Case, and I also felt anxious about the overtime and workload that was to come. However, I reported to a tool called BugTrack, recalling my initial intention to make it the best quality solution. The issue caused the version to roll back and lost time, but I felt a sense of accomplishment that I found Major issues and reflected on myself, who was afraid of working overtime. I was proud to think that I contributed to the development of myself, my team, and the program I was in charge of, and I felt the importance of honesty."
"I live a life of Dori and loyalty. I have always tried to keep my faith in others under any circumstances. So, there were always a lot of people around me, and even if it was a trivial meeting, I valued those meetings as important. During the summer vacation of high school, one of my friends and I went on a trip across the country by bike for two months, packed only basic cooking utensils and tents. At that time, I couldn't afford it financially and didn't have much to eat. That's how I traveled, and through that trip, I made friends in each region, and through those friends, I received help with sleeping and eating, and I still keep in touch with each other to return my help. In addition, I had a meeting while playing games online, and I met people who worked in various fields within the meeting, and I have been close to each other for over 10 years. I have had various experiences through such diverse connections. My strength is that I do my best in what is given, look at the people around me, and reflect on myself. And I have been actively socializing, and I have served as an undergraduate officer and representative for three consecutive years in my college life, and I have served as the president of three clubs. I have been working hard with a sense of responsibility and leadership with the concept that ""What is good for others is what is good for yourself."" Also, when it comes to work, I never roughly do my best, and I always do my best. In addition, I have made ceaseless efforts to achieve a higher level of completion in my work. It was a lot of experience, especially when I was working as a startup club. While participating in the competition through the club, I won the grand prize, and such things as ideas and presentation skills of excellent clubs or social workers teams at other universities became good experiences for me. In addition, I have had good social experiences through practical training and the national ICT internship system since I was a third grader. I hope that everyone will have a stable and good job and personal development. And I hope that I will start the first step in my social life in an excellent company that can further develop my abilities. That's why I applied for a job at NIT SERVICE Co., Ltd., which has the potential for many developments. Also, I am like a child now at work, but I applied to acquire many learning opportunities in it. Currently, I am not a talented person with much knowledge or practical skills, but I can confidently say that I have the growth potential to sublimate into a sense of mission as a person who is sincere and always works hard. If I join NIT SERVICE Co., Ltd., I will always strive to grow into an excellent person with various practical knowledge and skills. I am currently studying, and I plan to continue studying to improve my related work skills. I believe that the way to quickly adapt to all changes and gain an upper hand in the competition in the rapidly changing international community is to secure excellent human resources. I will become a talented person in your company who can become the subject of these changes and competition. I promise to value the necessary 'trust' in the organizational culture, consider others, and become a passionate and enterprising person who possesses both humanity and morality. The job I applied for is QA, which guarantees quality. The job is to detect errors by performing tests according to procedures using the process at NIT SERVICE. Ensure that the function is appropriate for the requirements and repeatedly test the basic unit functions of the output. In the service support and inquiry response work of Naver Pay/Store Farm API platform, technology is supported where Naver Pay and Sturopharm API are used. If you have any questions, respond to them. If a customer or company finds a problem while using it, QA will be conducted to find errors."
"I was born on Hangeul Day on Oct. 9. Born as the second of three brothers, I naturally learned how to respect my superiors and consider my subordinates. Thanks to my parents who had positive and bright energy, I was able to go through middle and high school without having a hard time. Seeing my parents working in the field with many difficulties, I promised to become a consistent and sincere person just like them who constantly and diligently work in one field even in difficult situations. I will become a sincere employee who gives off bright energy and does my best in my duties consistently. I have an open mind that is positive and respects diversity. I have an open mind that opens and accepts any possibilities. I am a person who constantly challenges myself with the idea that such positive energy can affect the people around me and do it even in difficult situations. I also treat people with respect and consideration, as I believe that the most important thing in society is human relationships. I am responsible for every given task until the end and finish it meticulously. In order to make up for the slowdown in work due to my meticulous personality, I can find my own know-how and process things accurately and quickly In one class, I learned basic window phone production and Arduino production. It was a little unreasonable to learn two things in one class, but I did my best to attend the class. After the midterm exam, the professor in charge asked me to develop a window phone and produce Arduino as a project at the end of the semester. I was very embarrassed because I only tasted it. However, I did my best because I had to do it to finish the semester. It's not a big deal, but I wrote a report according to the instructions that the report should be written properly, and I finished the semester with the submission. I felt very heavy due to the unexpected end-of-semester project, but I didn't give up and worked to the end regardless of the result. No matter how unexpected a problem arises, I think it's up to my mind. I learned that if I decide I can do it and don't give up until the end, the consequences will follow. I will become a talented person who constantly challenges without giving up with the mind that I can do anything. As an IT-related major, I started programming based on C language and mainly dealt with object-oriented languages such as C++ and JAVA. When dealing with data using SAS, I learned how to produce statistics and My SQL. I can say that I have the necessary skills and experience to perform IT tasks. In addition, I have experience in producing an SOS application that can transmit and record locations using the GPS and recording functions of a smartphone using Android Studio as my graduation work. I always do my best in a given situation. After entering university, I set the goal of grade scholarship, listened carefully without missing lectures, reviewed the classes I lacked, and did my best in my studies. As a result, I got first place in the department in the first semester and received a scholarship. Receiving the scholarship made me more greedy and I worked harder in my studies. Although I was not first place, I have consistently received scholarships for four years and worked hard in my studies. I will become a talented person who meets the expectations of the IBK system, which sets the goal of becoming the best in the IBK system with its strengths of sincerity and consistency, and constantly strives to achieve the goal. As I entered the university as an IT-related department, I became interested in something that I did not have in my adolescence and thought about my career path. It is a company that values the work and teamwork that can save my major, demonstrates the best teamwork and gives trust to customers, and finally, it is a company that leads me to the best capacity for my job. It is a company that trusts and uses customers deeply, a company that creates value for the happiness of customers, and a company that can lead the best teamwork. I applied because it is a company that has a foothold for further growth in the future, actively supporting the improvement of employees' work, and investing for the future. Through constant self-innovation, I will become a necessary core talent of the IBK system by quickly adapting to the rapidly changing IT era, striving to improve my job performance for a given task, and obtaining related certificates."
"The most difficult question is, but I think I am an evaluator of the National Insurance Review. When it comes to caring for the people and improving the health of the people, I think thinking about others is the priority over me. I don't think I'll know if I'm fit or not if I work. Please print it out for me. I'll do my best. I have little competence, but I don't think what I can do is small. When the existing method becomes complicated or has a lot of work, I use software convenience to provide a simple and quick response method or coordinate opinions with the engineer and the required part. There were parts that were usually not accepted, but in the end, they accepted the opinion that we should develop it in an easy direction. My work was not remarkable because it was a project with several programmers and companies, but I was happy and rewarding when the work was completed well. I performed the work with the help of colleagues, related data from A, or the advice of related engineers. I coordinated or coordinated the differences in opinions or interests between developers, engineers, and A while carrying out the business of the company. Since there are numerous engineers at each stage, meetings are frequent, and the outcome is important in the final stage, so I express my opinion in advance on sensitive issues. I respect the other person's opinion because most of the work is subordinate to the system that listens to others' opinions, and if I have a new idea, I will express my opinion, so if a new idea is outstanding or a new item, it will be adopted. I also tried to collect the opinions of seniors and colleagues in areas that I did not know at all. So, I received a lot of help from my colleagues and received advice from my boss. If I thought it was unfair, I also offered a different opinion. I tend to talk about things in advance about how to do this, how should I do this, and it seems that there were many things that the senior should consider because it's a newbie's burdensome part because it's a job with a senior like this. He was a grateful senior."
"I have come to realize that even a small change in things can be revolutionized, not just by developing and inventing things that go against the times. I have come to pay attention to the fact that small changes can distract and lead many people. Data analysis can help us understand the current public's interest, and we must manage it effectively to increase the value of our data. At a time when the importance of data is increasing, I will perform my duties with the responsibility that I contribute to the health, convenience, and stability of society, rather than collecting and managing a large amount of data meaninglessly. With this mindset, I will work passionately with the goal of protecting the welfare and health of the public at the Public Officials Pension Service, where vast amounts of public data gather. It will be efficient and planned for the status of the public corporation and the welfare of the public, and I will not lose my generous attitude such as maintaining security and managing robust networks as it is a place where a lot of data is gathered. I have experience in carrying out projects with the aim of using IOT smart farm equipment in Capstone design. With the help of many data search and acquaintances, I was able to produce frames using profiles and motors, and I controlled the sensors using Raspberry Pi and Arduino. The value for this was based on mysql, and the data was managed by establishing a database. Through trial and error, I learned that we must not lose our will, such as server construction, computer, Raspberry Pi, and mobile connection, and voice recognition technology that we did not expect when applying the first-time voice recognition technology. I think that the management of the public corporation's database is important in order to proceed with the work for pension and welfare. During the project, we will make sure that the work proceeds smoothly with the attitude and mindset of responding to errors. I think the information system is the most appropriate content among the contents I have been educated. The goal of this lecture was to learn the theory of basic network systems, databases, and management information systems. Introducing computer systems mainly for companies, I took practical environments and technology application cases during the training. Since I work to manage pensions and welfare, I think I need a lot of accounting and management knowledge even for computer workers. When I looked for the actual work arrangement, it was similar to what I expected. Economic knowledge is also essential to build and manage databases because it is a computer job that is deeply related to other tasks. When all these points were combined, I selected an information system among the training I received."
"It is a game derived from the world view of ""Haston"" World of Warcraft and is in the form of CCG. Unlike conventional card games, each card pack has a season expiration date, which enhances business continuously and provides users with a variety of gameplay. In particular, it has overcome the disadvantages of high satisfaction and boredom because it provides exotic attitudes such as ""speculation"" and ""tap shop struggle"". In addition, since both PC and mobile can play the game with the same interface, anyone can access it easily and quickly because there are no space and time constraints. ""Competition"" He was an ordinary child with nothing special since childhood. That's why I had a high sense of competition for my friends around me. I had a desire to do something that much when someone did something. The first start is competition for a cousin of a one-year-old boy, who turned 10 years old. When I listened to the sound of a prodigy by memorizing a thousand letters, I thought I could do it, so I started learning Chinese characters. While learning for the next four years, I felt a sense of accomplishment through the Chinese character test, and as a result, I received excellent grades in Chinese characters in middle and high school. During my school days, I started memorizing world maps as I competed with a friend who memorizes world geography, and I appeared in the Golden Bell as a specialty. Once again, when my friend's writing skills improved, I started reading essay writing and won an essay contest for the first time in my life. In the past and now, I am an ordinary person. However, I am full of aspirations to improve. In the future, I will continue to digest the strengths of people around me with my own and develop myself. There are many really important moments when playing games. The moment you beat Boss Monster in Reid, just before the game was decided, and you pushed your opponent with a trickery of your own accord... What if the game server explodes or a bug breaks out at this time? Just imagining it is terrible. Game QA plays a role in preventing the gamer's love for the game from cooling down by checking servers and systems countless times to prevent such a situation from occurring. To perform this role, stable server and system operation skills are required. After graduation, universities dealt with various server OSs, took information security-related lectures in vocational education, and improved equipment management and vulnerability inspection skills. I will become a game QA that responds quickly to any obstacles."
"""When I Like And Enjoy, Sometimes I'm Annoyed and Angry"" I think this is passionate to do something consistently that makes you like and enjoy it, and to have a combination of annoying and angry feelings. If you like something and enjoy it, someday you will get annoyed. It is because you run into limits, fail, or get frustrated. The will and effort to overcome these hardships is the definition of passion in my opinion. When I was in the second grade of middle school, I first learned how to play basketball from a friend. Friends who I first learned like me improved just by exercising together on a regular basis without much effort. But it was different for me. I was always halfway and behind. I didn't get the spotlight, and I was something I didn't need or needed. I was angry because I liked basketball more than anyone else and enjoyed it. So I practiced. I went to the basketball court in my apartment at 10 p.m. every evening and fried and threw it by myself. After more than six months of hard work, I reached a position where I could participate as the main player of the competition, and was recognized by my friends as well as skills that I am only good at. This experience has given me a sense of value that there is nothing I can't do if I have passion. I believe that anyone can do it no matter what the difficulties are. I had the experience of challenging programming with confidence while taking the 'Web Programming' course. At that time, I was not good at programming. I envied people who were much better than me, but I had a ambition that if I tried, there would be nothing I couldn't do. I personally learned by using books and internet lectures, and I carried out small projects and practiced at the same time. After hard work, I was able to proudly receive an A+, and that effort instilled my goal to become a Back-End developer. After achieving that goal, I have steadily studied on my own and have proudly passed the internship and development club. Although each failed once, I was able to achieve it by challenging with passion and confidence. After joining the company, you will face more adversity than you do now. However, I will become a developer of SoftSen who always grows with the confidence that there is nothing I can't do if I try hard and the passion I defined by myself as I have done so far. If the goal of 'growth and contribution through co-prosperity' is the same, I think I can contribute to the company actively as well as voluntary individual growth. I have a goal to become a Back-End developer. Furthermore, I want to build a career by moving on to the cloud and big data fields. In this respect, SoftSen decided that my goal was the same as mine. Currently, SoftSen provides web solutions based on cloud and big data. Therefore, I have confidence that I can grow quickly through leading learning because my goal and SoftSen's service are the same. For example, I have experienced voluntary efforts to build up the back-end development skills that I aimed for. I tried to improve my development skills by continuously refactoring my personal projects. Mainly, we perform refactoring in terms of improving code or applying newly learned technologies in an object-oriented manner. For example, I have experience repactoring the 'department bulletin board notification' in the order of Socket, JSP, Spring, ORM, RESTful API, module separation, and AWS. As such, I have tried to improve my development skills by applying various skills and knowledge learned through this experience to my actual code. Therefore, if the job goals are consistent, I think that of course, leading learning can lead to corporate performance naturally. Even after joining the company, I will not only simply organize the knowledge I learn, but I will also continue to grow as an S/W developer who can contribute to Softscene by improving my development skills by applying it to individual projects. In order to solve the problem of 'new article discrimination algorithm implemented with string', I constantly asked the question, ""Is there any other way to compensate for the exception?"" At first, I thought that there was no other way than what I implemented now. However, in order to break away from the existing thoughts, I constantly asked myself questions and suddenly popped up on the way home and was able to solve them. It would be nice if I could make it perfectly from the beginning, but most of them think that I have to go through 'refactoring'. Through this experience, I realized that continuous worries can provide clues to solving problems. I will always be responsible for my work and be reborn as a talented person who can solve problems through constant worries. #Problem 'How to determine new articles' There were two ways I thought of determining new articles. First, comparing the number of posts in Nth crawling with the number of posts in N+1th crawling. However, this method was unable to distinguish new posts because the number of posts would remain unchanged if the posts were deleted and added once between Nth and N+!th crawling. Second, comparing the number of posts and comparing URIs in the top posts. First, as a supplement to the method, even if the number of posts remains unchanged, if the URIs in the top posts are different, it is determined that a new post has been posted. In this case, similarly, if deletion and addition occur once within the crawling cycle, the URI values were the same because the posts have the same index, so we could not discriminate new posts. Comparing the titles of the top posts was an additional method, but we thought that this was not a fundamental solution because there was an exception that the title might be the same as the previous post in this case, and the code would get messy due to many variables. #Resolution We fixed the issue by using HashMap, Java's Collection. KEY of Map saved the URI of the post, VALUE saved the title of the post. The reason we used Map is that the URI of the post is guaranteed to be unique. Since the post request API usually uses the GET method, we focused on the feature that each post has a different query.As a result, we were able to identify a new article by finding the existing KEY, that is, the URI of the post, using the contentskey method between the existing data and the newly crawled data. We will fully understand the back-end that is the basis of the solution. Until now, we have been developing the back-end using Java and Spring Framework in private projects, interns, and development clubs. Therefore, I am confident that I can learn faster and fully utilize the Java web technology used in practice by bumping into each other. My weakness is that I have no experience related to big data and artificial intelligence. In order to turn my weaknesses into strengths, I will read the book 'Big Data Technology Learning as a Working Project' to get a sense of big data. After that, I will identify the big data-related technology stack used by SoftSEN and proceed with the personal project using the technology. AI will learn basic knowledge from deep learning to machine learning and proceed with projects that imitate the most basic AI programs. Through this, I will grow as a developer who can build up big data and artificial intelligence capabilities and develop core technologies. If it is clear what to do, no matter what difficulties there are in the process, it is my personality and strength to achieve them. For example, after setting a goal of becoming a Back-End developer, I experienced the adversity of being rejected by interns and development clubs in order to develop my Back-End skills. In order to overcome the hardships, I learned theories through books and internet lectures and proceeded with personal projects, developed my skills, and I was able to re-challenge and pass the examination with confidence. After joining the company, there are certainly many things I do not know, and I may be given assignments that are beyond the current level. However, I will become a developer who grows by achieving my goals for big data and artificial intelligence with the same challenging attitude as now."
"""The Best Value Partner"" There are three reasons why I applied for the Modern Information Technology. First, the vision of modern information technology to open a more convenient world with advanced technological skills and know-how is consistent with my vision. Second, it is the growth potential of modern information technology that supports domestic and international businesses with IT, such as the establishment of a next-generation system in the Vietnamese stock market and the establishment of an ATP signal system on the ground. Third, the human resources that modern information technology pursues are consistent with my values, which I am not afraid of failure and constantly strive for. To become a member of modern information technology, I took an applied SW engineer training course at OO Information Education Center, acquired various IT knowledge such as Java, JQuery, Oracle, and MyBatis, and gained practical experience by conducting projects to develop 'Free Video Lecture Site' and 'Secondhand Auction Site'. I will contribute to establishing modern information technology as The Best Value Partner by developing solutions that succeed L-Cloud based on my capabilities and core values of 5C. ""Collaboration, Growth DNA"" My growth DNA is 'collaboration'. When I was an undergraduate, I learned the power of collaboration by working on several team projects, and I have grown into a person who practices collaboration. For example, I have experience in collaborating in the 'In-school Course Registration System Improvement' project and obtaining results from the 7th to the 2nd in the final evaluation. The final goal of the project was to express the functions delivered by the improved system in UML such as use case, ERD, and DFD. To make matters worse, there was a team member who was left behind in a situation where a small number of people had to bear a large amount of work because the team member who was in charge of PM was excluded on the way due to early employment. Since I was a double major student, I was a team member who lacked basic knowledge of UML. I delivered reference materials, helped Q&A, and filled out the deficiencies of my team members. At first, it was somewhat difficult to learn unfamiliar concepts such as objects and attributes, but as a result of steadily helping me learn, I wrote DFD without difficulty. The task I was very overwhelming. However, when I first learned UML, I tried to understand the situation of the team member by recalling the old me, which was difficult, and I tried my best to recall that it was a common goal. This led everyone to participation without a single dropout. I think collaboration not only means that everyone works together to cooperate, but also that if there are colleagues who are struggling, they are willing to self-impose themselves and share and lead the difficulties. I will be a co-worker of modern information technology that creates team results by demonstrating my ability to collaborate, which is my main weapon in the IT industry, where collaboration is the main task. ""First Social Experience, OO Research"" The most memorable experience I had with interest and enthusiasm other than my studies was the OO research internship. It was my first social experience, so everything was unfamiliar and difficult, but through this experience, I learned the basic competencies necessary for working at a company, so it was the most memorable experience. My task was to develop an online survey page and manage the survey DB. While reviewing the survey DB conducted on the subject of 'children's education level according to whether parents are economically active or not', I found that the survey of respondents on parental leave was incorrectly classified as the economically active population. It occurred because the interviewer did not receive the purpose of the survey accurately, and we had to conduct an additional survey with little time left until the deadline. If smooth communication had taken place from the beginning, there would have been no such mistake. Since then, in order to minimize communication confusion, my intention has become to accurately communicate with the other party and to immediately take notes on what I have received. In addition, during my six-month internship, I learned an attitude that is trivial but should never be overlooked. For example, when I was handed a task, I realized that it was more important to ask questions immediately and accurately acquire the instructions and give them prompt and correct results, rather than try to reverse the task by myself if there was a blockage. I will show my communication skills, ability to perform tasks efficiently, and practical IT skills gained through experience in Korean research internship in modern information technology to the fullest. In this way, I will become a new employee who is good at modern information technology and wants to work with. ""Transfer convenience through creativity"" My strength is to make people's lives more convenient by adding creativity to the skills I gained through various projects. For example, I proposed a virtual manager account by demonstrating creativity in the ""Second-hand auction site development"" project. The goal of the project was to develop a used auction site where safe transactions are guaranteed by supplementing the limitations of used sites where disagreements arise during the pricing process, and where people can purchase the desired item at the desired price. I was in charge of linking membership DB such as membership registration, login, information modification, and withdrawal. For the safety transaction, which is the main focus of the development, I proposed a 'manager virtual account', a system in which the manager first manages the amount deposited by the buyer and then transfers the money to the seller after the buyer receives the item, to emphasize the difference from the existing used sites. As a result, it won first place in the creativity and convenience category among a total of eight teams. I think creativity is an essential element for developing technology that keeps up with the rapidly changing IT era. We are ready to support modern information technology that focuses on expanding cloud services and BI businesses through IT services based on creative thinking. ""Overcoming the 'urgent personality' by helping me,"" There are times when people around me feel burdened by my urgent personality. At the time of the project, I felt nervous as there were signs of being a little later than the schedule, and put an unexpected burden on my team members. Rather than just watching and getting nervous, I decided to help my team members after finishing my task quickly. ""Fourth Industrial Revolution, Cloud"" With the advent of the fourth industrial revolution, the IT trend that is emerging right now is ""cloud.""The cloud is at the core of the 4th Industrial Revolution, so it is called the cloud-based data revolution. Hyundai information technology is responding quickly to the 4th Industrial Revolution by providing integrated business solutions through the signing of MSP partnerships with Oracle Korea. My goal for the 10 years after joining the company is to participate in the response of modern information technology by developing cloud solutions that succeed L-Cloud. With this, I want to lay the foundation for Hyundai information technology to grow into a leader in the 4th Industrial Revolution. During my undergraduate years, I was working on the 'Smart Factory Design Plan Using Cloud Computing' project and discovered the limitations of SMEs that were unable to introduce smart factories due to lack of professional manpower and financing problems, and came up with an improvement plan using the cloud. I want to share the heart-rending work of actually building the designed system with modern information technology."
"This was when I participated in the Campus Patent Strategy Universiade. First, in order to understand the technology of the patent related to the technical equipment in question, the main components of the patent were analyzed and understood the technology. Then, based on the analysis, related patents and papers were found. I searched for the main components as keywords and found the core literature related to this patent. However, I looked for patent infringement products in Korea, but I couldn't find them, so I even reviewed the data sheets on the products of representative companies in the United States related to patents and found a product that is likely to infringe on this patent. And, judging that there is a possibility that this patent may be invalidated through the preceding literature, an avoidance design was suggested. As a result, I was able to obtain good results from the CEO award. I will become a new employee who is assigned to the IT department of Hanwha S&C in the position that I have achieved by challenging new things and eventually achieving them with my own attitude. Over the past six months, I have gained expertise and practical experience by participating in the on-campus 'Big Data Manager Course' conducted by the IT OOOO Association. I learned JAVA, JSP, Oracle, Hadoop, and R. I worked on a total of four projects on various topics and learned teamwork through communication. After that, I participated in the 'DA Design Contest' and modeled the data on the human resources management system of a company. While modeling data that meets the requirements of the company, I learned the practical skills of B2B, which are different from those of B2C. Based on this, I will become an essential human resource for sustainable growth as an IT leader. It was time to design an information search system as a graduation project. In the first evaluation among the progressive teams, our team, which was at the bottom of the evaluation in all areas, overcame difficulties and won the first place over all teams in the last final evaluation. We developed a system that enables users to search efficiently through pre-construction of technology classification and expansion of quality. I learned teamwork in the process of solving problems based on collaboration such as system design by taking each part. When I was in college, I was the team leader when I was working on a coffee vending machine design project. When I was working on this project, I tried to proceed with it by collecting everyone's opinions like a sponge. However, when I decided on the direction of progress including all opinions, the progress of the work was slowed down, so I couldn't complete the target design properly. In order to overcome this shortcoming, we will maintain the method of collecting opinions, but use a quick solution in reaching a consensus. The keyword of the IT industry is a challenge called 'CREATIVE' through the convergence of new technologies and existing fields. In addition, it is changing into an era of 'SMART' system and service that provides heat by adding one. With an interest in big data that will be considered more important in the future than today, I have developed related capabilities through the six-month 'Big Data Manager Course Training'. In addition, I designed an information retrieval system as a graduation project. The system was developed by the user through the algorithm through the pre-construction of the technology classification, the two-stage query expansion, similarity comparison, and text rank algorithm. This gave rise to the competence of SMART and CREATIVE. Companies are fiercely competing to take the lead in the market of the IoT, which is now and just around the corner. The IoT, which will be an important technology for the IT market and the overall industry, will be the goose that will produce a golden egg to create numerous values such as smart home services, self-driving cars, smart factories, etc. Hanwha S&C is striving to become a leader in the IoT market through an intelligent management system, a smart exhibition hall at COEX, etc. However, in order to lead the IoT market, Hanwha S&C needs to build its own infrastructure. I think that if we build our own infrastructure in preparation for the problems of the data surge that will come due to IoT problems in the future, we will be able to take a step ahead of other companies. To overcome this problem, there are ways to build infrastructure based on cloud computing, efficient storage, and big data analysis. It will be important for Hanwha S&C to take advantage of these factors in advance."

"I think the project ""PM specializing in risk management of production management"" started with business innovation. In order to generate profits for Samsung Electronics, I became the current Samsung Electronics by identifying, educating, and growing the merits of talented people. I want to be a risk management PM. I gained social experience in various fields by working in a lab for 7 years at a university and graduate school, and part-timer at a coffee shop and head hunting company for 4 years. While encountering IT technology from college to now, I think that the role I want to play and what I am good at are the role of ICT PM of Samsung Electronics. Although I lacked knowledge, I was able to expand my major competency in algorithms through the Internet and major books, and I was able to expand my knowledge deeply and broadly by visiting the professor and showing the design of the algorithm I think. These efforts enabled me to gain a holistic view of the IT industry, and I acquired knowledge of the entire computer by drawing CPU design by hand in the computer structure. When I was a graduate student, I was able to realize the practicality of knowledge by specializing in vehicle communication networks, and I gained additional capabilities in algorithm modeling as I proceeded with the business. I will try to become a PM for Samsung Electronics what I learned through YouTube, books, libraries, colleagues, seniors and juniors. I will become a PM specializing in risk management at Samsung Electronics in the future. Bruce Ekel, the author of Thinking in Java, a Java book called ""Extreme Development beyond 20X Productivity,"" said that the difference in productivity is more than 20 times depending on whether the algorithm is used properly. I am continuously making efforts to equip myself with the capabilities tailored to the convergence of hardware and software in order to create higher productivity through cooperation with Samsung Electronics in addition to synergy with technology workers. Based on the experience of programming in the Linux development environment since college, I have continuously gained experience between hardware and software by displaying pictures on embedded equipment in the Linux environment in the graduate school. I have taken actions to solve algorithmic competition problems since I was a college student and laid the foundation for my computer knowledge through differential calculus and engineering certification for the continuous development of the computer field, which is the basis of my capabilities. In order to continuously modify and improve simulations, the graduate school is making efforts not to miss the details while studying algorithmic problem-solving strategy books, and has the ability to draw an algorithmic blueprint using a modeling language on background paper. I have worked part-time at coffee shops, headhunting companies, and family restaurants for four years since I was an adult, and I have realized the importance of conversations with people in various fields and the need for consideration. At universities and graduate schools, I was able to be reborn as caring seniors and juniors among my friends, and I was able to give positive motivation to everyone by saying that whenever I was working on a team project, I was always possible. A mockup is a life-sized model that is made for product testing. I consider myself a mockup for the development of Samsung Electronics. Just as the graduate school's goal was to produce the most suitable and perfect simulation results by continuously modifying simulation experiments repeatedly, I tried to become a talented person who can be used practically for Samsung Electronics. As a human OOO, not a student in the Department of Computer Engineering, I visited Samsung Delight Shop as if I were having a meal as I was interested in laptops and tablets among electronic devices. Recently, as I became more interested in ultra-books, I watched videos of disassembling and assembling mechanical parts directly from YouTube, and bought an SSD myself, and made it fun to assemble it to a netbook at home, and test its performance. Samsung Electronics' unique technology instills great passion and dreams not only in terms of technology but also in the younger generation by creating smartphones, smart TVs, and Tizen operating systems that Samsung Electronics actually releases. In addition, I think Samsung Electronics is lighting up all classes of society by personally practicing continuous social activities through cooperation with Samsung Electronics' volunteer team and volunteers from the Korean Red Cross. As a Samsung Electronics person, I want to show dreams to someone through technology and reveal all aspects of society, so I want to be a mockup of Samsung Electronics. ""Is it connected right?"" I believe that connection is the core of the biggest social issue. The biggest example is the Fourth Industrial Revolution in the industry. Starting with smartphones, new terms such as ICT, big data, and connected cars poured out in the IT world, and as a result, large corporations began to expand their roles, SMEs began to expand their work, and new venture companies began to grow indiscriminately. However, while these growths and revolutions seem to be going in the good direction in the world, it is true that there are no real results in Korea. Take the Internet, which was considered the best in the world. Korea is the fastest. However, for the 5G that is emerging today, legislation and clear standards have not yet been properly designated, so it is common to follow international standards. Of course, it seems that there will be new winds and hopes in the industrial world due to measures such as creating its own OS like Samsung, but it is true that it is technically and practically lacking. What we need to look into here is the importance of connection. It is necessary to properly investigate the actual condition of the technologies centered on the connection that Korea currently has. I think that the cooperation of companies is becoming the most important accordingly. Large corporations accept new technologies when acquiring venture companies, but they must carefully investigate and properly acquire new technologies. Mid-sized companies and SMEs should focus their management capabilities on IT and focus on fostering new human resources. Of course, these aspects are essential requirements for a company, regardless of the size of the company.In addition, I believe that Samsung Electronics should be a first mover or a leader in new technologies through connection. Samsung Electronics should develop the driving force that can lead the Nth Industrial Revolution beyond Korea's 4th industry. Future convergence talents will be needed, and I will connect them through production management."
"""Success and Failure Through Challenges"" I am either oversensitive or overly cautious, and I am careful when speaking. To compensate for my shortcomings, I always act passionately with new goals. I have a habit of taking notes while carrying a ballpoint pen and notebook to check myself. When I was in college, I was curious as I participated in a college programming competition, and I developed logical sensitivity and passionate behavior. When I was in graduate school, I created ideas with researchers while exploring academic papers and overseas journals for new ideas related to vehicle communication while writing proposals, and I was able to contribute to ideas related to simulation and modeling. As a Korean fiS, I will contribute to the research and development of information technology that can create new and certain profits in the Nth industry through passionate brain activities and careful decisions. When I was a freshman in college, I took an engineering certification course and acquired basic design and development capabilities to become a talented person in Korean fiS. I acquired basic knowledge such as physics and mathematics for efficient software design, and I wanted to design and drive the device myself with the team while taking design courses such as engineering design and system analysis and design, and I wanted to get opportunities for design jobs while improving existing design methods. I tried to find a point of contact through the pleasure of communicating with the other person, interest in new information technology, and the convergence of my computer engineering knowledge, and I gradually embodied these ideas to target my business with the goal of convergent IT WooriFISIN. Through cooperation learned in team project design and acquisition of algorithmic knowledge in engineering certification, I developed the engineering design competency cultivated to me. I have three actions. The first was to read more books and learn all the time because I still have a lot of things to lack. The second was that I should be interested in developing systems as a computer engineering student. Finally, I had some free time to read good humanities books, or researched the latest technologies in person during network time. ""Target-tailored development for perfect systems."" An impressive example of my recognition is the graduate school experience. In the second semester of graduate school, I developed a safety service application for accurate vehicle communication simulation using Java programming. The safety service application that I developed was able to expand the research as it was used as a cornerstone of an application for safety services that was actively studied both at home and abroad in the vehicle communication laboratory where I graduated. Recently, the importance of building and operating customized systems for consumers is increasing. So, as a member of the FIES, I investigated the trends in the existing FIES infrastructure for the use of information technology safely and efficiently, and I think that what I can do to solve the inconvenience of the FIES people is to supplement the system through the knowledge of computer structure. Until now, I have studied computer structure and Internet security and am making efforts to consider the safety and efficiency of the system. In addition, among the experiences I had with a new colleague, I had worked on an Android development project. I applied for the FIES because I think my capabilities will be the most necessary foundation for our performance as the number one researcher that customers love. Bruce Ekel, the author of Thinking in Java, among the ""Extreme Development beyond Productivity"" Java books, said that the difference in productivity varies more than 20 times depending on whether the algorithm is used properly. I am continuously making efforts to equip myself with the capabilities tailored to the convergence of hardware and software in order to create higher productivity through cooperation with the FSIS as well as synergy with us. Based on my experience in programming in the Linux development environment since college, I have continuously gained experience between hardware and software by posting pictures on embedded equipment in the Linux environment in the graduate school. ""There is no impossibility of endless effort."" My efforts include the ability to become a simple, overcoming talent. In college, I completed software-related algorithms, programming, object orientation, and computer structure, and additionally completed basic mathematics and physics for the efficiency of algorithms. Through my major in system analysis design, I have developed the ability to design big pictures of software using software programs. Although I lacked knowledge at first, I was able to expand my major in algorithms through the Internet and major books, and I was able to expand my knowledge deeply and broadly by visiting my professor and showing him the blueprint of the algorithm I think. These efforts gave me a holistic view of the IT industry, and I have acquired knowledge of the entire computer by hand drawing CPU design in the computer structure. My lifetime goal is to believe in myself to be able to say that I am confident in what I am capable of doing. When I was in the fourth grade of college and was in the midst of interest in majoring in computer engineering and IT, I focused on employment and graduate school, and aligned myself with IT. ""I will do it because it is what I can do."" What people usually say before starting a job is usually concluded that the job is difficult and difficult because of what it is like. At the same time, I often give others the sense of failure in advance because I will fail. Since I was young, I have lived with positive consideration with my family. My father manages scrap metal in a hardware store. Whenever I replace my father's errand, I talk to the elderly who carry scrap metal and pull the rear car together. Although I was about the same age as a middle school student, I had a habit of helping with my father. My mother, who worked in a restaurant for decades, always told me to develop consideration for my family and others. As a Korean F.I.S. person, I will deal with all situations positively with fun difficulties if there are difficulties and creative ease if there are any.I will work hard to develop the smart finance industry beyond the development of our own. It is positive that has made my achievement experience prosperous. I have gained achievement experience in various fields by working in a lab for 7 years at a university and graduate school, and part-timer at a coffee shop and headhunting company for 4 years. As an intern, I had experience working on Android development projects with my creativity. It is about understanding the strengths of my team members. I think ""Is the connection right"" is the core of the biggest social issue. The biggest example is the Fourth Industrial Revolution in the industry. Starting with smartphones, new terms such as ICT, big data, and connected cars poured out in the IT world, and accordingly, large companies began to expand their roles, SMEs began to expand their work, and new venture companies began to grow indiscriminately. However, while these growth and revolutions seem to be going in a good direction in the world, it is true that there are no real results in Korea. It is necessary to properly investigate the actual conditions of technologies centered on the connections that Korea has. I think that the cooperation of companies is becoming the most important accordingly. I think that our FIS should be a first mover, that is, a leading point, more than a follower through the development and operation of the financial industry. To control the model through programming, I had continuous conversations with my team members, and I was able to show the safe movement of the device through logical algorithm design while modifying the code repeatedly. When I was in college, I encountered security in the Internet security lab and experienced the convenience of applications through Android apps. Our FIS will increase the driving force to lead the Nth Industrial Revolution beyond the 4th industry in Korea."
"As an intern, I had the experience of using my membership to carry out an Android development project. I was attached to the team and first suggested to two other intern members that they develop an app using GPS-related technology in Android, and I started the project development. However, my team member had a difficulty in that he had no experience in developing the technology called Android. Since all the strengths of the team members were different, I found an open-source project necessary to carry out the development as a member of the team and conducted a self-study with the team members after work. In addition, for the success of the team project, I asked the development team for help to receive feedback on the source code and the speed of running the program. As a result, I completed the intern project and received praise while shaking hands with the intern president. I gained social experience in various fields by working in the lab for 7 years at a university and graduate school, and part-timer at a coffee shop and headhunting company for 4 years. While conducting research on the radio wave model in my graduate thesis, I was immersed in the radio wave research. In addition, while studying the frequency usage status and wireless mobile communication technology such as mobile and vehicle in the wireless vehicle communication lab, I became interested in the status of Korean mobile communication. While talking to people in various fields, the center of my conversation has always been positive and led to good results. I got a good teamwork while working on the project in my university lab, and I was able to complete the first year of the project I was assigned to in graduate school. The future industry will be an era of convergence industries in which the gas facilities of the Korea Gas Stabilization Corporation and the gas industries of smart cars, mobile cars, medicine, and energy are merged. Rather than my own technological prowess, I will strive to develop the technological prowess of the Korea Gas Safety Corporation and expand the Korea Gas Safety Corporation's business that is more advanced for the satisfaction of the public at home and abroad. And what is important is also an important internal goal to become an executive of the Korea Gas Safety Corporation in the long run, planning and supervising the system so that I can lead the optimization of the smart ICT industrial environment. [Engineering Concerns and Exploration through Personality] The competencies that I feel most important while working on a project in the vehicle communication laboratory of the graduate school are personality such as positive attitude, correct personality, and smooth interpersonal relationships. I often worked with other teams, such as sharing test results with the Automotive Parts Research Institute, collaborating with research support teams, cooperating with other schools' laboratories, coordinating and developing work with researchers related to radio wave model projects that I have been in charge of since the second semester of graduate school. Since vehicle communication was the main field of study in graduate school, it was natural that knowledge, motivation, and major knowledge of wireless communication applied to vehicles were important, and I felt that the most important competency while actually taking charge of a project in the lab was personality, such as a positive attitude, correct personnel, and smooth interpersonal relationships. While working on a project with other teams, I studied on my own and learned what I did not know with a sense of ownership and enthusiasm from my seniors. With curiosity about the results of radio wave model simulation, I found and studied what I did not know by analyzing, modifying, and simulating the codes of my seniors. Through this process, I was able to inspire myself with constant motivation while maintaining passion and curiosity. The safety service application that I have developed has been able to expand my research by being used as a cornerstone of an application for safety services that is being actively studied both at home and abroad in the vehicle communication laboratory where I graduated. Rather than focusing only on me, I will make an engineering contribution through cooperation for the public safety, which is a common goal as a Korea Gas Safety Corporation, by developing engineering design capabilities cultivated by me through cooperation through team project design subjects and basic computer knowledge through engineering certification. Through my experience, I will operate a complete quality product customized for customers through a preliminary inspection of the information system of the Korea Gas Safety Corporation, which is directly related to the convenience and safety of customers. [Target-tailored development for perfect quality products] In the second semester of graduate school, I developed a safety service application for accurate vehicle communication simulation using Java programming. In order to cooperate with the Korea Automotive Parts Research Institute, which was the main target for the application, and the laboratory using actual vehicles of other universities, we started the development by comparing dozens of parameters and requirements. Since the main purpose of the application was an application for safety services, I studied the safety services currently being studied in advance, and studied additional proposed or modified parameters in academic societies and papers, and continued to study what is the most important point of safety services and what kind of companies are the main target groups. For example, another university that conducted research together requested research assistance on safety services, and I shared the research contents on the forward collision prevention system and the emergency collision prevention system among the safety services that I had been continuously researching. As I shared the research, I began to see improvements in the safety service applications that I had previously developed in my lab. It was regrettable that the development intention was not clear and above all, the results of the research could not be clearly shown because the existing application was to receive values from the simulation and display them on the screen while the vehicle was stopped. Based on these improvements, I used Java programming to show on the screen the location coordinates of one's own car and another's vehicle, the vehicle speed, etc., which were values received from the network simulator, while also making additional improvements so that the vehicle's location can be seen moving together according to the moving coordinate values. These improvements allowed other teams to conduct research by using the safety service application developed in our lab, first conducting the simulation, locating the vehicle, and helping to efficiently design the simulation from the actual vehicle. [A leader in the safety industry] I graduated from the Department of Electronic Computer and Communication Engineering.I have personally been interested in the connection between the gas safety corporation's infrastructure and the integrated safety industry while leading radio wave model research with my graduation thesis. So I applied to the Korea Gas Safety Corporation, which is a leader in the next generation of gas safety technology. I was fascinated by algorithms for hardware and software when I was in college and graduate school, and I completed logical circuit design, algorithms, industrial mathematics, and discrete mathematics for logical algorithms. I designed the algorithm for the products that have already been released, and I later planned and operated an information system related to gas safety so that everyone can use gas more safely or live a convenient life through the system I designed."
"[Student-Motivation] After working part-time at coffee shops, headhunting companies, and family restaurants for four years since I was an adult, I realized the importance of talking with people in various fields and the need for consideration. At universities and graduate schools, I was able to be reborn as caring seniors and juniors among my friends, and I was able to positively motivate everyone by saying that I was always able to do team projects. [Result of Action] I had experience working on Android development projects with my membership. I was attached to the team and first suggested to two other intern members that they develop an app using GPS-related technology on Android, and I started developing the project. However, my team member had a difficulty that they had no experience in developing Android technology. Since all the strengths of the team members were different, I found an open-source project needed to carry out the development as a member of the team and conducted a self-study after work with them. Also, for the success of the team project, I was able to ask the development team for help and get feedback from the staff. As a result, I was praised when I shook hands with the intern. [Personality-Positive] It is the affirmation that has made my social experience prosperous. I have gained social experience in various fields by working in a lab for 7 years at a university and graduate school, and part-timer at a coffee shop and headhunting company for 4 years. While talking to people in various fields, the center of my conversation has always been positive, and I have led to good results. I got a good teamwork while working on the project in my university lab, and I was able to complete the first year of the project I was assigned to in the graduate school and extend it to the second year. [Target-tailored development for perfect systems] The safety service application that I developed in my second semester of graduate school was used as a cornerstone of an application for safety services that has been actively studied both at home and abroad in the vehicle communication lab where I graduated, and I was able to expand my research. Recently, the importance of building and operating customized systems is increasing. I think what I can do to solve the inconvenience is to supplement the system through the knowledge of computer structure. While studying computer structure and Internet security, I am making efforts to consider the safety and efficiency of the system. [Motivation for application - Center of Eastern Finance] I applied to FIS System because I thought that FIS System was the safety net that managed the most important money for OO Group customers. While studying vehicle security in the lab, I was interested in financial security that was directly related to the customer's money, and my main motivation for application is to research and develop the core financial system in FIS System. [Up-Safety Application] When I was a university student, I encountered security in the Internet security lab and experienced the convenience of applications through the Android app. I also learned the applicability and scalability of security while taking an advanced security course in the graduate school lab. I thought that my job at FIS System was customized financial IT services. I will contribute my security research capabilities and application performance improvement capabilities to FIS System. [FIS-type talents] It is also important to become a FISIN who directly provides technical services to customers and enhances satisfaction. To this end, I will join FIS System and form a long-term team through continuous dialogue with seniors and colleagues. I will form a long-term team to speed up communication with customers and identify needs, and enhance the completeness of the project."
"[New Ideas Using Sensitivity and Carefulness] I am either oversensitive or overly cautious, and I am careful when speaking. To compensate for my shortcomings, I always act passionately with new goals. I have a habit of taking notes while carrying a ballpoint pen and notebook to check myself. When I was in college, I became curious as I participated in a college programming competition, and I developed logical sensitivity and passion. When I was in graduate school, I created ideas with researchers while exploring academic papers and overseas journals for new ideas related to vehicle communication, and I was able to contribute to ideas related to simulation and modeling. As a researcher of Korean energy technology, I will contribute to the research and development of information technology that can generate new and certain profits in the N-cha industry in the future through passionate brain activities and careful decisions. When I was a freshman in college, I took an engineering certification course and acquired basic design and development capabilities to become a talented person at the Korea Institute of Energy Technology in the future. I acquired basic knowledge such as physics and mathematics for efficient software design, and I wanted to design and operate devices with the team while taking design courses such as engineering design, system analysis, and design. I tried to find a point of contact through the enjoyment of communicating with the other party, interest in new information technology, and the convergence of my computer engineering knowledge, and I targeted my business with the goal of becoming a researcher of convergent IT Korean energy technology. Through the cooperation I learned in the team project design and the acquisition of algorithmic knowledge in the engineering certification, I developed the engineering design competency cultivated for me. That's why I applied to the Korea Institute of Energy Technology because I believe that my ability to capture customer needs through communication with researchers and provide services accordingly will be the most necessary foundation for the Korea Institute of Energy Technology's actions as the number one researcher that customers love. I think that [Is the connection right] is the core of the biggest social issue. The biggest example is the Fourth Industrial Revolution in the industry. Starting with smartphones, new terms such as ICT, big data, and connected cars poured out in the IT world, and as a result, large companies' roles were expanded, SMEs' workplaces were expanded, and new venture companies began to grow indiscriminately. However, while these growth and revolutions seem to be going in a good direction in the world, it is true that there are no real results in Korea. It is necessary to properly investigate the actual condition of the technologies centered on the connections that Korea has. I think that the cooperation of companies is becoming the most important. I think the Korea Institute of Energy Technology should be the first movers, or leaders, more than followers, through energy R&D. In order to control the model through programming, we had continuous conversations with our team members, and we were able to modify the code repeatedly and display safe movement of the device through logical algorithm design. The university's Internet Security Lab managed Windows and Ubuntu servers. He was in charge of user management and computer virus and physical security management in detail, and through this experience, the graduate school's lab managed file servers and integrated mail servers. For the accessibility and safety of management, all information was distributed and managed on hard disks, other computers, and the cloud, and anyone could access the information at any time. When I was a senior at university, I applied the concept of OTP to FTP application as a graduation thesis, and the graduate school developed a vehicle safety service application using Java. When I was in college, I encountered security in Internet security labs and experienced the convenience of applications through Android apps. The Korea Institute of Energy Technology will increase the driving force to lead the Nth Industrial Revolution beyond Korea's Fourth Industrial Revolution. [Extreme Development Beyond 20 Times] Bruce Ekel, the author of ""Thinking in Java"" among Java books, said that the difference in productivity is more than 20 times depending on whether the algorithm is used properly. I am making continuous efforts to equip myself with the capabilities tailored to the convergence of hardware and software to create higher productivity through cooperation with Korean energy technology researchers as well as synergy with Korean energy technology researchers. Based on the experience of programming in the Linux development environment since college, I have continuously gained experience between hardware and software by displaying pictures on embedded equipment in the Linux environment in graduate school. In order to continue to develop in the field of computing, which is the basis of my capabilities, I have taken actions to solve algorithmic competition problems since college, and I have laid the foundation for computer knowledge through mathematics courses through differential calculus and engineering certification. When I was developing a calendar application in college, I doubted my team and I to find out the difference from existing applications. However, I collected open-source projects and characteristic analysis of existing applications for three days until 10 p.m. with my team members to make doubts a joint success. As a result, I was able to turn doubts into excellent grades such as A and improved trust with my team members. In order to continuously modify and improve simulations, the graduate school is making efforts not to miss the detailed basics while studying algorithm problem-solving strategy books, with the ability to draw algorithmic design using modeling languages on backpapers. To this end, I will join the Korea Institute of Energy Technology and form a long-term team through continuous conversations with seniors and colleagues. As a researcher of Korea Energy Technology, I would like to be a mock-up of the Korea Institute of Energy Technology because I want to show my dreams to someone through technological skills and reveal all parts of society. [There is no impossibility in endless efforts] My efforts include the ability to become a simple overcoming talent. In college, I completed software-related algorithms, programming, object orientation, and computer structure, and additionally completed basic mathematics and physics for the efficiency of algorithms.Through my major in system analysis design, I developed the ability to design the big picture of software using software programs. At first, I lacked knowledge, but I expanded my major in algorithms through the Internet and major books, and I was able to expand my knowledge deeply and broadly by visiting the professor and showing him the blueprint of the algorithm I think. These efforts gave me a holistic view of the IT industry, and I acquired knowledge of the entire computer by hand drawing CPU design in the computer structure. My lifetime goal is to believe in myself to say that I can do what I am confidently. When I was in the fourth year of college and was interested in my major in computer engineering and IT, I agonized over employment and graduate school. Professors and seniors and juniors around me worried that it would be difficult to adapt and even fail if I went to another graduate school. However, in my head, I had a strong belief that I could do it. When I was in my fourth year of college, I believed that I would be an information technician of the Korea Institute of Energy Technology for the next 10, 20 years and the rest of my life. For my short-term tasks such as going to graduate school and graduating, I researched wireless communication trends, which were my areas of interest, and now I am continuing my efforts as a computer while carrying out the Java Open Source project. When I was in graduate school, I was able to realize the practicality of knowledge through professional research on vehicle communication networks, and as I proceeded with the business, I acquired additional capabilities in algorithm modeling. [I will do it because it is something I can do]. What people usually say before starting a job is usually concluded that the job is difficult and difficult because of what it is. At the same time, they often give others the sense of failure in advance because they will fail. Since I was a child, I have lived with positive consideration for my family. My father manages scrap metal in a hardware store. Every time I replaced my father's errands, I talked to the elderly who carried scrap metal and pulled a rear car with him. Although I was as young as a middle school student, I had a habit of helping along with him. My mother, who had worked in a restaurant for decades, always told me to develop consideration for my family and the other person. As a Korean energy technology researcher, I will respond positively to all situations with fun difficulties if there are difficulties and difficulties in the infrastructure for energy technology research. I will strive to develop the smart grid industry beyond the development of the Korea Institute of Energy Technology alone. It is positive that has made my achievement experience prosperous. I have gained achievement experience in various fields by working in the lab for 7 years at a university and graduate school, and part-timer at a coffee shop and headhunting company for 4 years. As an intern, I had experience working on an Android development project using my membership. Being attached to the team, I first suggested to two other intern members that they develop an app using GPS-related technology in Android, and I started developing the project. Since the strengths of the team members were all different, I found an open-source project necessary to carry out the development as a member of the team and conducted a self-study with the team members after work. While talking to people in various fields, the center of my conversation has always been positive, and I have led to good results. In the university lab, I got good teamwork by working on the project, and in the graduate school, I was able to complete the first year of the project I was in charge of and extend it to the second year."
"""Unstoppable Crisis for Development."" There were constant crises in my growth to become what I am today in Semes. First, I started with my parents. As the car center your father was running wasn't doing well, things went bad in his family, and eventually, he handed it over to someone else. My father became unemployed as a president. However, my father cheered up the way our family looked at it, and once again he bolstered to start working at a hardware store, and so far he has been running a wonderful hardware store. The second was when I was in college and contemplating computer science. I became interested in a field called computer science, and while I was on leave of absence, I thought about my major constantly as I gained social experience. I could imagine what I would be happy to do when I would later turn 40 or 50. But I say, I am committed to becoming a new employee of Semes and working with my colleagues to turn crises into opportunities and advance them. Bruce Ekel, the author of Thinking in Java, in his book ""Extreme Productivity Over 20 Times,"" says that depending on the proper use of the algorithm, productivity varies more than 20 times. I am continuously making efforts to equip myself with capabilities tailored to the convergence of hardware and software in order to create higher productivity through cooperation with Semes people. I have been interested in computer science since I was a college student by solving algorithmic competition problems for the continuous development of the computer field, which is the basis of my capabilities. I have worked part-time at coffee shops, headhunting companies, and family restaurants for four years since I was an adult, and I have realized the importance of talking with people in various fields and the need for consideration. It was the most meaningful activity to strengthen myself and constantly motivate myself while reading books about people I respect. ""New Ideas Using Sensitivity and Carefulness"" In my life, the incident began with the attack of weaknesses. My weaknesses are either oversensitive or overly cautious, and I am careful when speaking. To compensate for my weaknesses, I always act passionately with new goals. I have a habit of taking notes while carrying a ballpoint pen and notebook to check myself. When I was in college, I participated in a programming competition and became curious, and I developed logical sensitivity and passionate behavior. When I was in graduate school, I created ideas with researchers while exploring academic papers and overseas journals for new ideas related to vehicle communication while writing proposals, and I was able to contribute to ideas related to simulation and modeling. I used excessive sensitivity and prudence to come up with ideas in my head, but I was able to get quick problem-solving ideas through passionate brain activities and body movements. As a Semes person, I will contribute to the creation of new and certain profits in the semiconductor and display equipment industries through passionate brain activities and careful decisions. ""Division, harmony, flow of change"" As a college student, I liked to be active and exercise, and I worked as a soccer club and a coffee shop part-time in the lab. There were some difficulties while working at the same time as a lab activity and a part-time job for four years, but I had a great attachment, so I struggled with my body, but I acted responsibly. As the number of students in the lab increased to more than 30, individual responsibilities decreased, and problems arose as the number of students who did not participate increased. I suggested the division of labor to the lab students, and I tried to promote the importance of group activities such as general affairs, mentor mentee system, and cleaning, and efficiently carry out the activities in the lab. Due to my sensitive but passionate decision on laboratory activities, students actively participated and all worked in harmony. We will lead the change in global equipment quality competitiveness along with the Semes through proper division and harmony of our work. ""Is it connected properly?"" I believe that connection is the core of the semiconductor and display equipment industries. And I think connection is the core of the biggest social issue. The biggest example is the Fourth Industrial Revolution in the industry. Starting with smartphones, new terms such as ICT, big data, and connected cars poured out in the IT world, and accordingly, large companies began to expand their roles, SMEs began to expand their work, and new venture companies began to grow indiscriminately. Take the Internet, which was considered the best in the world. Korea is the fastest. However, for the 5G that is emerging, legislation and clear standards have not yet been properly designated, so it is common to follow international standards. Although it seems that there will be a new wind and hope in the industrial world as various measures have been taken, it is true that it is lacking technically and practically. What we need to look at here is the importance of connection. It is necessary to properly investigate the actual condition of the technologies that are centered on the connections currently in Korea. I think that the cooperation of companies is becoming the most important accordingly. Large companies accept new technologies when acquiring venture companies, but they must carefully examine how far they can go and acquire new technologies. Mid-sized companies and SMEs should focus their management capabilities on IT and focus on nurturing new human resources. Of course, these aspects are essential requirements for a company, regardless of its size. In addition, I think that Semes should be a first mover or a leader in new technologies through connection. Semes should build a driving force that can lead the Nth Industrial Revolution beyond the 4th industry in Korea. Future convergence talents like me will be needed at the center of it, and Semes should provide appropriate connections accordingly."
"[New Myth through Open Mind and Positive Thinking] In college, I completed algorithms, programming, object orientation, computer structure, etc. related to software, and additionally completed basic mathematics and physics for the efficiency of algorithms. Through my major in system analysis and design, I have developed the ability to design big pictures of software using software programs. I have continuously discovered possibilities through an open mind about learning, positive thoughts that I can do it, and endless efforts. Through the Internet and major books, I was able to expand my major competence in algorithms, and by visiting professors and showing them the design of algorithms I think, I was able to expand my knowledge deeply and widely. I was able to gain knowledge of algorithms, and in the computer structure, I acquired knowledge of the entire computer by drawing CPU design by hand. When I was in graduate school, I was able to realize the practicality of knowledge by professionally researching vehicle communication networks, how computer networks can be applied in real life, and I secured the ability to model algorithms while working on the project. [Action based on the thought of taking care of forests and trees] - Personality Keyword: 'Concrete Action.' The important point of my personality is the perspective of taking care of forests and trees. There are two important points of view when performing tasks. It is the same perspective as a forest looking at the whole, and the same perspective as a tree that can be divided in detail and continuously recognized and influenced. As a project researcher, I have practiced concrete actions through my strengths. To see the overall forest, I held meetings with master's researchers twice a week while conducting thesis seminars and watching open-source projects on the suitability and actual driving environment of the radio wave model, which were the goals of the project. In order to recognize the details and have a successful impact on the project results, the three masters involved in the project implementation were asked to perform the work of debugging their source codes themselves.

Before joining the company, if you have prepared for various colors of competency with your studies and various experiences, you will draw your dreams on the canvas of work by using various colors of competency. Just as the more diverse the colors, the more colorful the pictures become, I will try to draw dreams through various colors even after joining the company. [I will be an SE expert at E-Land Systems, which boasts the optimal distribution system] I think the key to E-Land's success based on its optimized system is its IT capabilities. I am confident that E-Land Systems, which is in charge of E-Land's enterprise-wide management through differentiated IT solutions and new technologies, is an optimized company that I can contribute to E-Land. I studied Green IT, Smart Grid, Big Data, and Beacon with great interest to understand the rapidly changing flow of the IT market. In particular, while working as an intern at a company whose main business is LTE communication solutions, I was able to directly experience home network technology by participating in a smart meter project that measures the power consumption of each household and transmits data to electric companies through LTE signals.

I have supported to become an SE that can provide growth of E-Land Systems by creating E-Land network solutions that can be applied to store management and distribution in the future. [The spirit of pioneering the creation of something out of nothing] To describe myself in one word, I am a person who practices something out of nothing. In other words, creating something out of nothing, focusing on what others have not come up with, and putting it into action in order to realize it. Since I was young, I used to draw pictures of future undersea cities, food, and fashion that others could not have imagined. Seeing my paintings, people around me were surprised and praised me for having unique ideas at the same time. I became interested in programming that allowed me to express my unique ideas freely as if I were drawing on canvas, and naturally went on to major in computer science. [Challenge 'first' through 'discrimination'] As a first step toward surprising the world with unique ideas, I started a fashion shopping mall called 'OO.'It was intended to provide the trust and convenience of customers through the rather unconventional operation method of 'pre-check and payment' which is differentiated from the operation method of the existing shopping mall called 'pre-payment and confirmation'. In addition, through the concept of personalized styling service, we tried to be competitive with existing shopping malls, and targeted niche markets by selecting men rather than women as our main customer base. Naturally, this became the first in the shopping mall industry to realize individualized O2O styling service for men, and returns and refunds have occurred at an average rate of 4% lower than competitors. Based on these results, we were able to get an opportunity to be selected as a nurturing start-up company for oo. [Leaving one's feet to find team members] We wanted to unite with people from various fields for the professional operation of the fashion shopping mall. We wanted to form a college student start-up team consisting of various majors such as business administration for the operation of shopping malls, fashion design department in charge of stylists and MDs, and media design department in charge of the design and design of UX/UI of service apps. In order to gather team members in each field, I ran on my feet, posted a talent recruitment poster on the bulletin board of the university student center, and posted a recruitment announcement on the online bulletin board of the major of various universities. After seeing the recruitment announcement, I was able to meet the students who contacted me in person to confirm the applicant's passion for starting a business. Through this, we were able to form passionate team members to lead OO. [Communication to achieve 'communication' through 'communication'] After the formation of the team, I tried to create better services through smooth communication with each team member. As the developer in charge of me, I did not pay attention only to development work, but talked a lot with the planner to understand the service function and the intention of planning, and discussed a lot of time with the designer for efficient UX/UI. Above all, I tried to improve the service process by grasping what inconveniences customers feel through conversations with stylists who actually face-to-face with customers and what difficulties the stylists felt in face-to-face with customers. E-Land Systems will take the lead in realizing the Digital Innovation that E-Land Systems dreams of by demonstrating the 'challenge', 'pioneering spirit' gained through start-ups, and 'communication ability' that can radiate synergy effects of team members."
