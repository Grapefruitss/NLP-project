"My family consists of four members: my father, mother, older sister and me, who are office workers. During my school years, I was interested in reading books and continued to read books in a wide range of fields, especially reading classics such as the biography of great men, classics, and Eastern and Western philosophy. As a result, I have acquired the ability to understand and empathize with various human images, excellent reason and logic, while also building up my knowledge of the humanities and trying to imitate great men. Because of these traits, I made friendship with friends who like reading books and who have desirable moral senses and humility, and I studied based on my sincere lifestyle by going to school early in the morning and leaving school after self-study at night, following the example of sincere and honest parents. After reading Lee Ji-sung's ""Dreaming Attic Room,"" I realized that by having a big dream, the criminal can be reborn as a great man and eventually achieve that dream, and this greatly influenced me, so that I have a lifelong dream to live a better society."" ""There is a case in which I was greatly frustrated at the beginning due to my lack of skills in analyzing data allocated during the internship program at the AI research institute OOO, but I eventually achieved the best performance among internships by building strategic competencies and overcoming them. Having the most insufficient data analysis capabilities among interns, I was assigned certain predictive accuracy calculations by seven laggle competitions, but voluntarily challenged larger goals and implemented strategies to systematically grow my capabilities by overachieving work-level overachievement. As a result, I achieved the highest performance and received incentives and full-time offers."", The securities industry majored in business administration hoping to become a financier as it guarantees a stable economic life for its customers with data-based strategies and insights.

"In the summer of the fourth grade, an AI research institute challenged me for an AI engineering internship for two months. Three of the seven laggle competitions were assigned to calculate prediction accuracy within 40%, and four were assigned to calculate prediction accuracy within 100%, but I voluntarily challenged the goal of calculating prediction accuracy within 40% of all seven. I set a goal to derive a solution focusing on competition, which analyzes the DB of global companies using the management major domain. At first, I thought that the possibility of achieving the goal was close to zero because I had the most lack of data analysis experience and AI capabilities among interns. In fact, in the beginning, I was frustrated because I did not know how to use basic open sources such as PANDAs and Sykitruns. So to achieve the final goal, we classified the difficulty of competition from 1 to 7, selected seven competitions including all difficulties, and established a strategy to achieve systematic competency growth and final goal through step-by-step overachievement. As a result of persistent accumulation of competency, I achieved the best performance among interns, receiving incentives and offers for full-time employment. In addition, I am preparing to publish MFE and AutoML research results as papers. Based on this experience, even after joining SK C&C, if I challenge myself with new skills and learning without fear, I will build up the necessary competencies and eventually overcome them."" ""I went to the SW contest in the school and showed my passion to achieve my goal of winning the award despite the limited time due to my lack of web development skills and job preparation. My existing development method was to implement it step by step by step by looking at the textbook. However, with the deadline approaching, the result was a basic level, so I boldly took a new approach. It was to study the optimal library and implementation method necessary for implementing the function by referring to the source code that already implemented the function I wanted. The reason I made a bold attempt was because I wanted to present the joy of winning the award to a team member who trusted and followed me, who was not good enough. However, my friends gave me a negative opinion that they would not understand the difficult codes because they were preparing for employment, and they did not have enough time to invest in development. In order to build up development capabilities, I focused only on web development with my team members for the rest of the days, while completing other studies early by minimizing unnecessary time spent in daily life and increasing the number of study hours a day to 10 hours a week. Seeing this, my friends also gave me a lot of advice. As a result, the team was able to win the award by implementing the initially targeted elementary school education support web app called ""OOO,"" which includes video chat, real-time conversation, and bulletin board functions. I will become an engineer who is also creative in SK C&C."",,,,"
"I was impressed by watching/cleaning movies, respectful people, and practicing values. I don't want to be a sparrow passing by the mill. I want to discover unknown insights from Cheil Worldwide's digital panel data. While studying data analysis, I was interested in customer behavior data. I enjoyed the process of analyzing people's behavior in multiple dimensions and finding meaning. I was naturally interested in the advertising industry, where customer data was collected in real-time and used for decision-making. While spending my first internship at an advertising company, you can feel the data-friendly atmosphere of the advertising industry directly on the spot. In particular, Cheil Worldwide is the most active in implementing the data-driven business among many advertising companies. We secure high-quality data by operating large-scale digital panels centered on the DNA center. I would like to proceed with the project so that meaningful planning can be achieved by analyzing this. I want to create a variable that is close to CDM by processing the existing variable that exists in the digital panel data. I have experience dealing with LPoint's customer log data through a competition. Elaborate targeting of retention members was performed by using the 'traces' variables that accumulated and averaged existing variables based on access behavior. Since Cheil's panel data is collected from various channels, the amount of variables will be significant. I would like to apply various methodologies to find the criteria for customer segmentation by exploring all variables one by one. ""Since childhood, I have considered a clear sense of goal as a virtue. I enjoyed the process of making plans to achieve my goals, and implementing them step by step. It was the secret to having a pleasant time in my school days marked by competition and examination. However, things have changed since I went to college. I was not able to enter the department I wanted, so I was not motivated why I had to study statistics. The reason I recovered my sense of goal was mentoring. Over three years, I have met about 200 high school mentees while working in an educational volunteer club. Ironically, I have looked back on myself while consulting students who are struggling with their grades. Locking myself within the framework of grades and underestimating myself was their common problem. He advised me to ""break the mold and look at myself."" In addition to grades, I also looked for factors that could positively evaluate me. It was a time to enlighten myself. It was an opportunity to reflect on myself, who was trapped within the framework of 'not suitable for aptitude' and did not try to find meaning. The choice I made after enlightenment was a conflict. I entered the Big Data Society with the determination to study data analysis from the beginning. While working at the society for a year, I studied programming, basic statistics, and machine learning. Life in the society became an opportunity to set my goal to become a data analyst. I enjoyed the process of deriving answers that fit the purpose from the numbers of complex matrices. I was also able to learn attitudes toward data from colleagues in various majors such as sound engineering and sociology. Seeing colleagues trying to use data in their respective fields, I became greedy to find such a domain. When I opened my eyes, I abandoned my previous passive attitude. I grew together by sharing the experience beyond studying with the members of the society. After forming a group, I learned deep learning techniques that were not present in the original curriculum and transcribed excellent codes in the calligraphy. I formed a team to experience different kinds of data and participated in six contests. At the same time as being honored, I was able to discover my own taste in data that I wanted to study for the rest of my life. I started an internship at the same time as an academic conference. I wanted to experience the data use field. I worked at an advertising agency to collect basic data. By voluntarily automating work in a programming language, I was able to shorten the time required from 5 days to 3 days. Through the small experience of success, I was able to see the importance of an attitude to be active in work. I also worked for a platform company that runs big data contests because I wanted to deal with them myself and apply algorithms. Before the contest, I devised problems in the contest by analyzing and processing initial data from clients, and after the contest, I reviewed the codes for excellent works. I was able to improve my understanding of data and learn several methodologies. The two internship experiences remain as traces of my passionate and goal-consciousness."","" said the three data law amendments allow me to analyze customer behavior patterns precisely. The Data Act 3 refers to the three laws: the Personal Information Protection Act, the Information and Communication Network Act, and the Credit Information Act. The gist of the amendment is to consider ways to use personal information as data by revising this, but to give companies a sense of responsibility by presenting clear standards. The advantage of the amendment in my opinion is the potential of pseudonymous information. Pseudonym information is data that removes information that can identify individuals such as name, resident registration number, and phone number from personal information. For statistical analysis purposes, pseudonymous information data can be used without the consent of the customer regardless of the purpose. In addition, since the data of different companies can be combined through specialized institutions, different data can be combined and utilized with existing data. It is expected that financial and medical data, which have been difficult to access because it has been treated as sensitive information, will be actively utilized. I think that this sensitive information will also be used in the advertising market. Due to the digitization of customer behavior, the amount of data that individuals produce per day is significant. Various variables are needed to elaborately design personalized services. The customer segment can be subdivided based on sensitive information, thereby enabling more rational targeting. For example, in combination with financial and credit information data, a recommendation service can be devised that takes into account various financial conditions such as the customer's loan status, balance, and credit score. In particular, Cheil expects to create greater synergy by fusion of other data with digital panel data.Data analysts need a higher level of communication skills. As the volume of data increases, I think the importance of collaboration will emerge. In particular, domain knowledge is often required to deal with sensitive information, so collaboration with experts is required. Therefore, communication skills are as important as data analysis capabilities. I think a proven analyst who has successfully performed collaboration processes such as projects and contests is the reason why first planning needs it."",,,,"
"""I want to contribute to innovation with statistical capabilities that I have developed using coding."" The first major class that caught my attention as a freshman was a computer data processing class. Using statistical programs such as R and SAS, I was able to dig into statistical principles more without being distracted by complicated calculations. I had fun realizing the principles through coding, so I studied them with interest and enthusiasm enough to work in the class. I gained confidence from the class, studied Python and VBA additionally by myself, and learned how to use R markdowns and how to implement various codes such as regular expressions, and steadily developed statistical analysis and coding skills. For me, LG CNS is the perfect company to demonstrate my capabilities and develop related skills. I got to know the company through my motivation to work as an intern at the headquarters, and I thought it was a place where I could come up with ideas and analyze them using real data and work with a sense of reward for usefulness. At LG CNS, which plays a key role in developing technologies that are used most closely in daily life, such as transportation cards and Kakao Pay, I would like to participate in gaining meaningful insights and creating innovations through a large amount of data. In particular, I would like to work on the smart factory and smart logistics business promoted by the headquarters. I think this business will lead the 4th industrial era by connecting industries through digital platforms. We will conduct meaningful analysis that helps various industries by using data from companies in various industries that are difficult to access. I would like to participate in the SW Boot Camp and learn the languages such as JAVA and C in depth to get an opportunity to practice with real big data. After joining the company, I will become an expert in the field of smart factories by developing my ability as a data expert by learning IT skills, reflecting intuition in the analysis. I feel proud in the process of deriving meaning from logically designed analysis results, rather than simply processing and inserting data into a set statistical analysis framework. In order to develop my expertise as a data analyst, I learned various methods of accessing data and interpreting results by looking at examples of analysis, and proceeded with the project myself. By comparing the performance of different models in my major class, I have gained experience by making a demand forecasting model using a random forest model and receiving feedback from the professor in Seoul. Last semester, I participated in the panel big data analysis competition held by our school and carried out the project. Using apps and credit card payment data of 115,854 respondents, the analysis was conducted on the subject of consumption patterns of grooming people (male interested in beauty). In the process, we had to create variables that represent the degree of interest in beauty for each respondent. We came up with a method to measure the degree of interest in beauty by assigning the reciprocal of the frequency as the importance to each cosmetic item and scoring it. Through tree model, logistic regression, and correlation analysis, we were able to get cosmetics marketing insights from men and received the second prize. We can see data from a new perspective and analyze it with creativity. ""Confidence in coding developed by challenging various tools."" ""I am passionate about coding tools. I used to voluntarily learn and incorporate other programs based on my R and SAS skills during statistical analysis as well as other activities. When I was working as the vice chairman of the financial association, I taught other students how to find bond prices using Python and how to run Monte Carlo simulations. When I was an intern at an insurance company, I learned the VBA by myself and automated repetitive tasks after seeing that I used Excel for most of my tasks. As such, I have the ability to acquire tools and computer languages for new practical tasks based on the spirit of challenge.""?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"""
"I have developed an attitude that not only considers ""converged thinking that appears to be an action,"" but also puts it into action. It was based on the strong encouragement of my parents to 'try anything because it is okay to fail' from an early age. It was a big difference in that I could turn what anyone could think into action. When I was a bachelor's degree, I majored in computer engineering and thought a lot about what value IT technology can create when it converges with other fields. Furthermore, I have actively developed convergent thinking by directly transferring it to project execution. First, I have experience in developing an 'IoT-based facility failure prediction system' in connection with the manufacturing industry with OOO in a graduation project conducted through industry-academia cooperation. I was usually interested in smart factories, so I proposed it first after writing the plan, and among them, I developed my expertise by being in charge of sensor value design, DB design, and construction. Second, in order to revitalize the traditional market, I took a Capstone design course that allows IT projects on the subject of freedom. It was very interesting to try to apply IT technology by finding problems and seeing and feeling in the market. I developed 'IoT-based traffic assistance device' to improve traffic problems in the market, and I was in charge of developing software installed on the device. I will try to make my experience of convergent thinking and professionalism in translating into these actions lead to an active work attitude even in Nautilus efficiency,"""" Embedded Software,"""" Algorithm,"" and Embedded Software"" are two keywords that express the competence that I have developed. While taking a creative engineering design course, I became interested in Embedded Software. Through Mindstorm programming using NXC, I created robots and installed software. It was very interesting to see real robots in action, not the monitor console screen. This interest led to an interest in IoT as I went up to the senior level. Not only programming languages but also network and DB knowledge were necessary, so I took data communication, DB system, and artificial intelligence courses. I have experience in developing pet behavior detection platform and pot monitoring system based on small modules as two representative projects using IoT. Through this project, I was able to gain deep knowledge about Raspberry Pi and Arduino, which are ultra-small PCs. In addition, I judged that knowledge and utilization of 'alternative algorithms' are the most important for programming efficiency. Therefore, until recently, I have taken state-funded education for training algorithm-based Java developers, learned privately through algorithm learning sites, and supplemented my skills. As the two competencies I have developed are essential elements for developing software and solutions that will fit into various machines owned by Nautilus Hyosung, I will quickly adapt to increase technological competitiveness. Strengthen comprehensive self-banking solutions,"""" I applied because I wanted to make a leap to become a comprehensive self-banking solution company that Nautilus Hyosung aims for. Currently, Nautilus Hyosung is experiencing various opportunities and changes due to the emergence of Internet-only banks and the decrease in branches of existing banks. At this point, I was able to see its positive attitude toward R&D by seeing the increase in exports of 'NBS', a self-banking solution, and the development of various solutions to realize unmanned banks. When I was a bachelor's degree, I was interested in embedded software and worked on a number of IoT-related projects. I judged that the Nautilus's effectiveness, which requires the harmony of ATMs and solutions, could be the best of my ability. We will focus on accelerating the smart ATM business further and strengthening our technological prowess to match the increase in non-face-to-face channels. ""Increase and expand business agreements"" As a way to increase the market competitiveness of the business unit, the government should push for the expansion of business agreements with the banking sector and the introduction of AI services in Korea. If additional authorization of Internet-only banks is implemented within this year, the number of non-face-to-face channels will increase further. It is necessary to expand services that can be solved with ATMs and accelerate the spread of smart ATM devices by installing interactive AI services. Overseas, we need to expand our business activities more actively. As our technology is being recognized by expanding the export of 'NBS', a self-banking solution, it is necessary to strengthen our business strategy to find a market that can enter the market.""???,,,,"
"One of the things I wanted to achieve intensely was to enter graduate school and do convergence research. The biggest reason I wanted to do convergence research was that I wanted to do something valuable using my IT knowledge. I majored in in information and communication electronics, but I was tired of simply improving the performance of technology. It is because core technology is included in all products and services, but technology eventually develops for people. Sometimes, when I see services released to show off new technologies, I feel sorry for the idea that users did not consider at all. Although the 4th Industrial Revolution has not been clearly defined yet, it is developing into a hyper-connected, hyper-intelligent society, so it is necessary to understand people from the research stage. Just like studying human brains at Midas IT, I also immersed myself in convergence research by studying HCI, human behavior and user experiences. There are two examples of improving the waiting time for children's hospitals at OO Hospital, which produced good results while conducting convergence research, and curating services at the Gyeonggi Museum. The first was to organize a human+engineer and a humanian team with a lab colleagues and propose cooperation to the hospital by e-mail. It has been a very difficult task that has not been solved for decades, even though many hospitals recognize that waiting time is much longer than the treatment time. It was impossible to increase the number of doctors or reduce the number of people treated per day due to a problem that was directly connected to the hospital's profits. Recognizing the limitation that physical time could not be shortened, I looked at it from a psychological perspective. As I constantly interviewed, empathized, and communicated with nurses, patients, and guardians, I began to see one or two clues to the study, and considering that all patients are children, I was able to develop analog art tools and digital fairy tales that can forget boredom through fun. We designed a scenario and are currently developing a demo so that if children input their own drawings through a scanner, it can become a fairy tale story on the TV in the waiting room. It is too early to say that it was completely successful because it has not yet been commercialized, but I expect it to respond well because it reflected all the feelings felt in the field during the demo development process. The second is the case of launching a smart curating service using the Bluetooth function and beacon of a smartphone when viewing the permanent exhibition at the OOO Museum. As an industry-academia joint project, I formed a team with one company and majors in planning, design, and participated, and I was able to communicate in a multidisciplinary team to experience the design process and learn design sensibilities. I was responsible for researching indoor location-based algorithms. Initially, Bluetooth signals were used to implement them, but the accuracy of wireless signals was low indoors for actual commercialization services. As a result of the test, the service we wanted was not properly performed, and other methods were needed for better performance. After much consideration, we implemented the algorithm by fusing relatively accurate magnetic field sensors, and we were able to solve some of the problems in terms of accuracy. Through this, we published a number of papers and successfully applied for two patents. I learned that commercialization services are very difficult, unlike projects that were simply developed as demonstrations at schools. The final test process also took a considerable amount of time because errors can lead to customer loss. It was the most meaningful time because I was able to indirectly experience the process from a company like Midas IT to the creation of a new service, and I could also sympathize with the fact that many people's efforts follow behind it. I think the biggest reason why I was able to solve the problem in the above two cases was the rendezvous between various majors. Due to the nature of the laboratory, humanities, design, and engineering majors were able to achieve outstanding results through constant communication and collaboration. Even though I am an engineer, I was able to communicate with my team members more easily because I have discovered problems while observing people with them and have experienced field interviews. I am proud that my experience of designing every process from problem recognition to solution can help me create values even as a member of Midas IT. Based on the collaboration and convergence capabilities I have acquired over the past two years, I would like to create new customer value that combines technology and business with Midas IT. I believe that the practical competencies in the web solution technology field are four in the order of importance: collaboration competencies, convergence competencies, problem solving competencies, and professional technology competencies. Among them, I would like to give 88 out of 100 points for my competency (calculation basis: collaboration competency (30%), convergence competency (30%) - 95 points, problem solving competency (20%) - 85 points, professional technology competency (20%) - 70 points, 95*0.3 + 95*0.3 + 85*0.2 + 70*0.2 = 88) Collaboration competency I have been working as an OOOO since March 2016 until now. The biggest reason I feel proud and attached to being a member of OOOO is that I am conducting human-centered research based on technology. The human-friendly HCI field pursued by OOOO is considered an essential study in the Fourth Industrial Revolution, but it is recognized as a very unfamiliar field as it is in its early stages in Korea. OOOO has the advantage of having the research ability of humanities, design, and engineering majors to design every process from problem recognition to solutions to create the best synergy. As a researcher for OOOO's master's program over the past year, I managed 600 million won in assignment costs alone, and I was able to achieve excellent results in annual evaluation by using it efficiently. In addition, I was able to enjoy the honor of jointly winning the Popularity Award and the Special Award by prototyping a walking aid that corrects my posture at the Medical Hackathon 2016 held at OOOO Hospital. In addition, we made great efforts to develop the department through the launch of application services and patent applications through industry-academia cooperation.Convergence Competency I was able to experience the design process and learn about the design sensibility at OO Design School. It may be ironic that engineering majors study design, but I studied UX design because I thought it would be difficult to create good products without going through UX design process that recognizes humanities value judgment and emotions rather than technology in the upcoming Fourth Industrial Revolution. With the convergence of development skills learned in the undergraduate Department of Information and Communication Electronics Engineering with research in the HCI and UX fields at the graduate school, we are ready for the upcoming fourth industrial revolution. Currently, even in the laboratory, we are used to constantly creating new things through multidisciplinary convergence research, and we are carrying out the First Mover mission of ICT, emotion, and design convergence technology that draws out social and human communication skills according to the changing demand of the times based on user experience rather than technology-oriented. I saw many students standing in line in the elevator on the way to the problem-solving competency class and looked for ways to increase the utilization rate of stairs. I thought that if I could play the piano sound when climbing the stairs, it would increase the use of stairs and reduce elevator congestion. When I investigated previous studies and cases, there was a case where it was manufactured using a pressure sensor. It was judged that the use of a pressure sensor could cause frequent breakdowns when many people used it, and it was differentiated into a non-contact method and a low unit price infrared sensor in order to use it for a long time without residual failure. An academic small meeting conducted a project to solve the problem. A sensor detected human feet and a scale suitable for each step was outputted through a speaker. Troubleshooting by electric power occurred during the output process, but the cause was found through a systematic approach and analysis and it was solved through ground reorganization. It was memorable for a long time that it was installed on campus for 3 days to receive the attention of students and professors, and that it resolved the inconvenience that began with a sense of improvement. Above all, it is an unforgettable memory that the project solved the inconvenience in life. In addition, in the OOO study, I remember getting on the subway line 1 directly, measuring carbon dioxide, and counting the number of passengers in the cabin, one by one. We were able to analyze the correlation between the amount of carbon dioxide and people, and achieve the results of exhibiting at the OOO Demo Session in Germany. I became interested in AI through a professional technology competency webinar, and I have experience in presenting a paper to the Korea OOO Association using IBM Watson API Demo. The thesis topic is ""OOO,"" and we experimented with Watson's Visual Recognition, Text to Speech Demo, which shows a high recognition rate. Recently, I am studying deep learning, one of the fields of artificial intelligence, and I am also studying various classification algorithms through supporting statistics and data mining classes. Using open sources, I created AI Amazon Alexa with Raspberry Pi, microphone, and speaker, and implemented a stock price prediction program. In the ""Development and validation of interactive language learning device"" project, we are testing an object recognition application demo that learned 1000 objects, and we are reading related papers to find ways to increase the recognition rate. Since June, I have participated in the research project ""Study for enhancement performance of robustness and precision in fingerprinting and PDR technologies for indoor location estimation"" to collect and analyze data. As we are currently in the early stages of research, we are looking for related studies, and the ultimate goal is to estimate the indoor location more accurately and robustly through deep learning of wireless signals. Although I have not been able to highly evaluate my professional competence as I have just started studying AI, I will confidently promise that I will be reborn as a talented person who will lead the company in the distant future if we grow together and build up our capabilities at Midas IT."",,,,"
"I thought that we should deepen our knowledge through active practical activities that accurately learn and apply what we have learned. I was in charge of planning and coding at the 2016 OOOO Challenge app development competition organized by OOO last year. As a result of brainstorming as a team of five people, we decided to create an app that provides a service that people with mental problems can easily share their concerns and wrote a plan. As a result, I was able to pass the preliminary round and advance to the finals. From this period on, I was in charge of coding for producing apps and implemented UI/UX and functions. Unfortunately, however, I was eliminated from the finals and the activities were suspended, so I was unable to complete them. Through this competition, I have acquired overall theories and skills in app production, and my project planning methods and ideas have improved a lot. In addition, at the 'IT Hope School with Tmax Soft', I learned the language necessary for website production such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to conduct individual and group projects. While thinking about what kind of homepage I should make for my personal project, I made a self-introduction homepage that briefly introduces me, and in the group project, I made a roulette homepage that helps me select and organize on duty. After producing the homepage, not only did my web production skills improve, but also my presentation skills improved by giving a presentation in front of the CEO and other executives and staff members. Through this experience, I have a lot to learn from failures and have realized that active activities are a good way to develop expertise. ""A person who achieves his or her goals"" I was told by a teacher at the youth training center in front of the school called the ""International OOO Awards."" This program is an international self-growth program that enables you to realize your potential through four activities: physical training, self-development, volunteer work and exploration, and to have life skills that change you, your community and your country. I started at the lowest level in this activity, the Dong (six months). My goal was to build a web page for self-development, build muscles for physical training, organize library books for volunteer activities, and set up the last expedition activity as the main pillar of Baekdudaegan. I could easily finish my self-development and volunteer activities because I had been doing it steadily, but I ran after only the final goal without making any specific plans for physical training and exploration activities. When the teacher saw me like this, he told me that I ran only after the final goal, and that I had no choice but to hate doing activities that I did not like. Having identified the problem, I found and selected my favorite activities and made a detailed plan. For physical training activities, I planned to do exercises by part, such as leg exercise for one day and chest exercise for one day, and for exploration, I planned to climb three mountains for a total of three nights and four days. As a result of this detailed plan and activities, I successfully completed all activities, passed the reward screening, and obtained the head of the Dong. It was never easy to set a goal and put it into action while doing this activity, but I was able to successfully finish it because of my parents and teachers who supported me by my side, and gained confidence in achieving the goal.""""Hit it and pierce it, and it will work if you go through difficulties."""""" In my second year of high school, there was an English presentation competition where I gave a presentation in English about my major. The given time was only 10 days. Since it had to be completed in a short period of time, the key was how to capture the eyes and ears of listeners. For the first five days, I practiced in front of my friends and family for about two days, just like my friends who opened the event, where I selected themes, produced presentation materials, and practiced presentation on the level of reading materials while standing still. However, less than half of the presentation, everyone commented, ""I was less concentrated and nervous."" I almost fell into frustration with the first competition coming up, but I decided to do it on my own soon and decided to do it myself. After watching my presentation on a video, I thought it would be better to proceed with the presentation in a talk method that communicates with listeners rather than a hard one. On the day of the competition, I performed a differentiated stage from the participants who only made arm gestures or stood still and presented. As a result, I was able to successfully finish my presentation without getting nervous on stage, and although it was an incentive award, I received a better evaluation than other teams in terms of presentation. While preparing for the competition, I was pushed out of time and had a hard time in situations where I had to bump into anything, but I was able to develop my creativity, develop the perseverance to manage through difficulties, and learn how not to be nervous in front of many people. ""The driving force behind teamwork is active communication."" When I was a freshman, I participated in a program called OOO, a middleware development company, for about eight months from April to December, to create and provide websites for executives and employees. This program is a mission where four people form a group and implement websites related to a topic based on the web site production techniques learned during one semester. With the expectation that all the members of the group would create a website, they initially presented a lot of ideas and showed their positive attitude. However, as each member demanded more, I couldn't concentrate and started to become lazy in everything. As a result, the conflict worsened because the members of the team had to make each other's way and because they acted selfishly, saying that they should make it their own way. Due to the nature of the project where teamwork is important, a big crisis has come to our group. As a team leader, I invited each member of the team to listen to and sympathize with the upset, pointed out the wrong parts, and broke down the walls of my mind to resolve the conflict one by one. In addition, I decided to create a roulette site where I was in charge of program production, one in planning, one in debugging, and one in design, and choose the role that I could best play.Doing so made the project faster and faster, and the team members showed their positive side as they did in the beginning. Finally, our group completed the project and won the valuable result of being second out of five groups. While working on this project project, I have gained confidence that whatever difficulties arise, I can overcome conflicts and resolve them through communication and consideration.""???,,,"
"""Man Who Doesn't Give Up"" I am interested in business activities of a company, so I majored in business administration multiple times. The difficulty while taking the business administration class was a lack of basic knowledge. In particular, the trade class was most difficult because various knowledge such as terminology, customs clearance, transportation, payment, etc. were required, and in addition, the grades of the semester were evaluated as trade project performance. The project was a personal task of discovering competitive items in Korea and selling them to overseas buyers under the theme of 'Finding Overseas Buyers.' It was not easy for me, which was not familiar with trade, to compete with business students. So I decided to bump into it first. First of all, I had a lot of conversations with a Chinese exchange student who was helping me adjust to life in Korea to get an idea. At that time, the smartphone trend was in full swing in China, and since the Chinese people liked gold, I selected a gold decorated smartphone case as an item. Due to my lack of knowledge and experience in trade, I had continuous consultation with the professor. After seeing my enthusiastic attitude, I introduced him to a professor who was engaged in the trade business, and he introduced me to another acquaintance, so I could get a lot of advice on the project. It was also my first time looking for a company, so I recklessly ran around and visited several companies, and after several failures, I was able to find a company called ""DDPOP"" and get an offer at a reasonable price. Later, with the help of a Chinese friend in Chinese, I was able to export three kinds of products to a company using Alibaba in China. As a result, I succeeded in the project and became the most notable student in this class after the presentation. Through this experience, I learned that I can overcome any unfamiliar field as long as I have the spirit of challenge and the driving force to support it. ""What the Youngest Can Do"" The organization that I feel most affiliated with is the Early Football Association, which has been active for seven years. The reason is that I have been active since the foundation of the soccer association until now, and I only like soccer and meet people every week. The most memorable experience was the separation of teams. Eunpyeong New Town FC has members of various ages from their 20s to 50s. As many diverse people gathered, they had different expectations for the soccer team. Some members wanted to play against talented teams and compete in competitions, while others wanted to play fairly and exercise without injury. Opinions were divided, and eventually, the young members who wanted to win the game withdrew from the soccer team. It was very painful because I relied on them when I was in trouble and could no longer see them with my brothers who have been with me for a long time. I decided that this was a matter of affection and communication, and I didn't want to repeat the same experience again. After much thought about what kind of role I could play as the youngest member of the soccer team, I decided that I could play two roles. First, I started working as vice president by helping the general manager. I volunteered to recruit the opposing team to notify the game on the cafe, and contacted the members. In addition, I led by example to carry operation boards and water before the game starts and clean up the trash after the game. Second, I created a place to communicate. I tried to revitalize the cafe by promoting a picnic where I could play soccer and eat with my family, and posting humor and reviews of the game on the soccer team's cafe every week. The members were proud that the youngest has a great love for the soccer team. Now, we have become a soccer team full of love, sharing each other's updates at cafes and having a meal with family once a month. I think our hearts are connected. I promise to become a new employee who truly communicates and thinks about what can be done for the organization. ""No innovation, No Future"" In-school software engineering lab carried out the national task of 'Rebuilding S/W Architecture'. Despite the successful completion of the research by developing a solution, it is my great pride to improve the solution for better performance and to publish this process as a paper in an international journal. The widely used template-based web application (TWA) method has the advantage of code management through modularization, but there is a problem that data that does not require renewal is transmitted and processed on the server. I developed a solution using the Azax technology and the PJAX framework, and through this, I was able to successfully complete the study. However, while conducting performance tests after developing the solution, I was able to find that the solution using the framework has large capacity and is difficult to use. So, I decided to form a team with one of my colleagues to create a lightweight and convenient solution. I had to develop a solution and live undergraduate life at the same time, so I had to pay a lot of attention to time management such as assignments, team meetings, and test periods. Through the two-month development period and more than 20 improvements, the solution was completed without a framework. Through this, we were able to complete a solution that converts the TWA method into a single-page web application (SPA) method that updates only the parts that are needed. In addition, by organizing this process, we have achieved great results in publishing a paper in the COMPSAC organized by IEEE in 2013. ""No innovation, No Future"" I think there will be no further development without new attempts and challenges. Through constant worries and actions, I will grow into an engineer who provides the highest quality service."",,,,"
"[The Core of Future Technology, IoT] I heard that LG CNS has recently obtained the IOT International Standard Certification 'oneM2M' and CoAP Protocol interworking compatibility certification for the first time in the IT service industry. I first got introduced to the CoAP technology through the undergraduate graduation project and became interested in IOT, so I developed the graduation project using the beacon technology. IOT technology is the center of the future industry and I think it can make human life richer. My dream is to develop technology that people can make more convenient by using less labor through IOT. LG CNS is investing a lot to develop IOT technology, such as smart robots for cleaning server facilities and developing set-top boxes for smart home implementation. I think they are going the same way as me in developing services for people. I want to build my LG WAY at LG CNS, which puts customer value first. I once participated in a project competition organized by the CEST Embedded Research Institute as a team with my friends. The theme is ""Smart Bicycle Cluster Driving Using BLE Beacons,"" which measures the current coordinates of electric bicycles and the distance between the bicycles through GPS and beacon correction algorithms, and displays the bicycle's location on the mobile phone application. Arduino has implemented an automatic speed control function that slows down electric bicycles when the distance between the bicycles is closer than the reference distance and increases their speed when the distance is getting farther. In recognition of the achievements after the completion of the project, I interned at the institute during the winter vacation of the third grade. The institute focused on the ZigBee-based electronic price indicator (ESL) project and supplied it to hypermarkets and department stores. I worked to update the server DB of the ESL program and test bugs, and in the process, I learned more about the structure of the ESL program."" [Building a Perfect Smart Farm System] LG CNS has learned that it plans to complete the smart farm by investing heavily in the Saemangeum foothold by 2022. Agriculture is an inseparable entity in our lives. However, as the number of people engaged in agriculture is decreasing and the labor force is decreasing, I think smart farm technology is essential. I will take over as the ITP of LG CNS and contribute to the establishment of a perfect smart farm system. Furthermore, in 10 years, I will try to stabilize and expand the smart farm system in Saemangeum Reclamation Area to build a vast smart farm like Agreport A7 area in the Netherlands. To this end, we will learn the technologies necessary for smart farm automation, such as automatic temperature control system using IOT technology, water supply system, and cultivation quality analysis system. And we will make LG the leading in the smart farm field by supplementing the automation technology for harvesting and packaging, which is still insufficient technology in terms of customer satisfaction.""???????????????,,,,"
"[Game is named] Since I was young, I have always been interested in games, and I have been playing them continuously, to the extent that most famous games in Korea have been played. My parents didn't let me play games, saying they weren't helpful for my soul, and I used to play them secretly all the time. Usually, people consider games to be bad, but some people get energized by them. A game is defined by how the user uses them. I wanted to give people a boost through games because I thought they were a place to live and get people energized, so I applied for game server programming. [Let the World Play with Us!] My favorite phrase from NHN Ent.'s four introductions is 'Let the World Play with Us!' Knowing the fun and joy of games, and having people who know them make games and sharing them with the wider world and greater fun for more people. I have a goal similar to mine that I want to revitalize through games, so I applied because I think just working for NHN Ent. would be a grateful thing. In addition, I think I can grow through the company by encouraging new education, sharing skills, and establishing a welfare system for people. ""My favorite game is Dungeon & Fighter."" Dunpa is an online action RPG game based on a solid worldview and exciting stories. It is based on a dungeon that users farm, and a special content dungeon, a multi-user participate to complete, is held every specific day of the week. The difficulty of dungeon is properly set until a beginner becomes a skilled worker, and along with that, avatar content that users can enjoy is well established. Although Dunpa's final content is 'Luke Reid,' it shows strength in avatar content enough for users to jokingly call it 'look+duck,' and stands out even more because there are many characters to choose from. However, there are many complaints from users because the number of jobs is too large and the recent update does not seem to consider the user, causing complaints from users. In addition, the overall system is based on probability, including the 'hell party's' epic item drop rate to get good equipment, and is evaluated as a 'lucky game'. It is a game that weighs between effort and luck, but it is good to play with pleasure and has a large number of users, so it is appropriate to play together. In particular, the specifications of characters that are important in RPG games are well-formed into several stages, so I can say that it is a good RPG game.""""Pixelcube hopes to play games that are simple, but require brains or quickness. I like those games, too, and I enjoy playing games like Sudoku, Square Nemo, and Janggi. Complex games like RPG and FPS are fun, but I think simple games like this should be well-made and entertaining. Just as the foundation is the most important when building a house, the market for games needs to be well-developed if the basic games are well-organized. It is also good for the market to use such simple games to prevent dementia in an aging modern society. I think it's important to make simple games in many aspects like this, so I hope to join Pixelcube."",,,,"
"In college, I participated in a contest and developed a score recognition program with the goal of winning an award. In college, I participated in a contest and produced a game with the goal of winning an award. The assignment was to provide convenience to beginners or advanced users who wanted to learn by recognizing guitar scores through video processing and making it easier to store and modify. Sometimes, when friends learn how to play the guitar, they forget the exact guitar code after about a year. So, through this APP, they can view their own music anywhere they are on mobile devices. However, despite our efforts, we received a lot of criticism in the final evaluation. The reason was that we wanted to complete the project only with coding technology, but the UI/UX part used by users was not good. So, we found out that we needed to cooperate with people in various fields. So, we proposed to collaborate with a design department that the club had not promoted before. There was also a lot of opposition from colleagues who were burdened with collaboration with other departments. It seemed that there was a fear of recognition because it was a new attempt. However, when I finished the project, I thought it would give everyone a great spirit of challenge. So I first approached the opposing team members and persuaded them by telling them why collaboration is necessary. And I built a teamwork through many conversations. With these actions, I made plans myself and made and pushed forward with detailed schedules. So I had a lot of conversations with the members of the club, and I was able to get positive support from the opposing team members. In the end, I received the Best Teamwork Award at the Samsung SW Competition due to favorable reviews in design and collaboration among team members. From this experience, I was able to see that passion for a goal and collaboration with people in other fields are important when working on a project. Even after joining SK C&C, I will develop a lot of technical skills so that I won't give up."" ""In college, I participated in the energy hackathon, developed the fintech program, engaged in the Imagine Cup, and engaged in the score recognition program to be creative,"""" ""Energy hackathon: Thinking about where to go."" ""I went out to the hackathon and did not give up even when I encountered time limits, but I had the experience of showing passion without giving up. The biggest problem was the short production time when I participated in the hackathon. Usually, when we produce a program, it takes a long time, but we struggled with the production idea in two days. It's because no matter how good an idea comes out, it's a failure if you don't complete it in two days. So, after a lot of thinking with my team members, I decided on the idea. It was to create a Fin Tech APP that could plan electricity use by allowing you to check your electricity usage in advance with a smartphone. However, since a lot of fintech technologies have already been released, the surrounding people gave negative opinions. So we thought differently and thought about whether it was convenient to use it from a user's point of view, even though it was already made. Young people usually use smart devices well, but my grandmother and grandfather came up with something that was still difficult and uncomfortable for the blind. So, for the elderly and the visually impaired who do not use electronic devices well, we decided to add an ARS function to implement a function that can inform them of the amount of money they have used by voice according to their current power. I made the Android part and let the team members use their respective APIs to make it. I shared the roles and proceeded according to the limited time. At first, I thought it would be difficult, but I didn't give up and tried hard, and it was completed in a short time and received the Energy Hackathon. Although it was a short time, I was able to learn a lot because I came up with an idea that fit the topic and divided the tasks according to the period and won first place. From now on, I will maintain this persistence and try to complete it without giving up despite many difficulties even after joining SK C&C."""", ""Get an OCP"" I took a DB class when I was a third grader. But I was most interested in this class than any other subject. Data base is an important technology that goes into all programs. This is because even a small program needs to build a DB to take information and use it again. So I acquired OCP DBA-10g to gain DB knowledge. I have been studying database faithfully, but I also needed to study other patterns to prepare for OCP. As I developed the POS System, I increased the convenience and safety of users by analyzing User Data and showing it as Chart. I was able to pass the test based on the DB knowledge I gained by creating ADO.NET POS with high safety using Oracle myself. As I engaged in various internship activities, I gained many experiences like MySQL. I think OCP DBA-10g has granted me the qualification to be recognized anywhere in the world, not limited to Korea. If you know a solid DB as an IT expert, it is easy to understand the technology to process information. I am still posting seminars I conducted on YouTube to gain strong expertise and gaining DB knowledge through SK T Academy. I will join SK C&C and sublimate various problems into my expertise."" ""Experience of preparing for a contest with people around me while working as a club in college,"" ""People who know responsibility and act on a team project."" ""Responsibility and cooperation are important. I learned that when I started a club when I was in college. When I first joined an academic club, I was preparing for a contest. But I thought the contest was not about solving problems alone like a school assignment, but about solving problems with my team members.So I thought I should show better performance to my juniors. So, the club held a seminar for 10 juniors every week, and when I was working on the project, I arrived at the appointment earlier than anyone else to prepare for the project. And while it is important to be trusted by others through actions, I think it is also important to be trusted by others with the heart, so I often talked with the club members with the same mindset. In addition, while preparing for the Imagine Cup and the Capstone Design Energy Hackathon, I became the leader of the team, felt responsible for the project, conducted it, and communicated with my team members. As a result, I was able to take the position of the head of education within the club and received the Best Teamwork Award at the Samsung Electronics Competition. These experiences can create rapid organizational convergence and synergy after joining the company."",,,,"
"-While working as a personalized service intern, I built a web service that records and manages it as 'my to-do', a personalized service. There are many TODO services, but now many people make a lot of things to do through job studies, but I tried to solve the inconvenience of not sharing the schedule due to spatial constraints by making a TODO list. And I started with the mind of actually producing it using everything I learned. The project proceeded with a personal project. First of all, I made a statement of demand and thought about the DB structure, and I kept thinking about what I needed. I started making it using Spring Boot, and the DB used MySQL. And I applied the method of using Nested Results for Collection with the Mapper of MyBatis. And for CI, Jenkins made it easier to manage continuously. And I wrote a cleaner code using coding conversion, and I made them test the code of the service sector through UnitTest. And I tried to develop the service sector more safely using transactions. But there were also difficulties that I had while proceeding. Among the input types supported by Chrome, it was a problem when receiving objects directly from Spring using datetime-local. There was no problem when I received Date or Time, but an error occurred when I used datetime-local. When I debugged it in detail, the form of datetime-local was yyy-MM-dd Thh:mm, and special characters entered the middle, so it could not be automatically substituted. So I used Converter to convert the received inputs to Date. On the contrary, when I took them from DB and sent them to JSP, I easily solved them using JSTL. I have previous experience of winning them through hackathon or contests. However, I thought this project was the best project because I thought about the technology and safety and efficiency that I applied to the best practice. Usually, contests only see ideas and execution, but as I was working on this project, I thought about Clean Code. Even if it is implemented, I found out which data structure is appropriate to use for each object and which part has changed and requires understanding of API. Unlike students, in practice, a project is not carried out by one person but by several people. Therefore, I think we need someone who has experience in CI and thinks about algorithms and safe codes. Therefore, I think I can grow in TicketMonster. Even if I join TicketMonster in the future, I will be an applicant who writes while thinking about even a line of code.?????????"
"-The field I am most interested in in server development is web server development. This is because programs that communicate with other programs or import information through communication to a server can operate more functions than a single program. Since the most people are active on a platform called the web, I thought that many services could be provided and more services were required in the future. As for my experience in the web server field, while working as an intern, I built a web service that records and manages as a personalized service called 'My to-do'.

"[Developer who fills up if it is not enough and learns if it is not enough] I think that the development and operation job should be based on the knowledge of programming, so that you have the understanding of the system and the knowledge of the field you want to develop. In order to gain knowledge of programming, I took the database design course as I thought that the biggest role of the IT system was to store data and provide the information that users need. In addition, I learned Java, Oracle, JSP, etc. and experienced various projects through the completion of 600 hours of external training called the Big Data Manager course. [Experience of collaborating with people in various fields] While completing external training, I have experience working with people from the same department as well as people from other departments to work on projects and participate in competitions. Among them, when I participated in the DA design contest hosted by the Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, four people from four departments with different data architecture design experiences and background knowledge formed a team, and there was a problem of frequent disagreement. However, the disagreement allowed me to see the problem from various perspectives and proceeded with the design by making use of each team member's strengths. [Happy : A month and a half trip to Europe] I took a leave of absence from college after finishing my third year and went on a backpacking trip to Europe to earn money on my own. While living in college, I thought that I really wanted to experience something different from other people's, so I decided to go on a backpacking trip to Europe. I convinced my parents that traveling alone was dangerous, and I worked part-time at a construction site in Suwon to save money. After work every day, I made plans by searching for travel information with my tired body, and I left for Paris, France on May 7. Due to my tight travel expenses, I often skipped meals and felt lonely by myself. The difference in language and culture also made the trip feel difficult. It was 'people' that made me overcome all these difficulties. [Sadness : Job Failure in the second half of the year] This may seem like a common thing because it is what most job seekers go through these days, but the saddest thing in my life was failing to get a job in the second half of last year. In the second half of last year, when I was in the second semester of my fourth year of college, I couldn't prepare much for employment due to graduation projects and outside classes. So I didn't have high expectations, and if I can't, I prepared for employment with the thought of doing it next time. However, one by one, I lost confidence as the documents fell and I failed the personality test, and as my friends around me got a job, I became impatient. Also, it was miserable to think that I didn't meet my parents' expectations. However, while preparing for recruitment in the first half of this year, I started studying algorithms and data structure, which I thought was insufficient, and I prepared step by step, and I found promising companies that I didn't know about last year. It was the saddest and least confident period, but rather, it was an opportunity to fill in the deficiencies and broaden my horizons, and I applied to Bartek Networks. If there is a shortage in Bartek Networks, I will become a professional and passionate developer with the mindset of actively filling in."
"I was into games when I was in middle and high school. I played many games, including Star, FIFA, and Sudden, and was one of the top five games on campus. That's how I enjoyed playing games, so I entered the Department of Computer Engineering. As I entered the Department of Computer Engineering, I was attracted to programming while taking seminars and classes. As a program developer, it was rewarding that the code I made could help users, and I made it a profession. In particular, I thought that the development of individual programs by various customer groups such as PCs and mobiles would be diversified, and accordingly, I developed my practical skills through internship and club competitions to gain expertise in program development. #NotFearingFailureAttitudeI formed a team within the university. While I was signing a contract to lead a team to carry out a government project, I was also selected for the project, and I agonized over it. Many of the team members said, ""It's hard to accomplish one task, but it's hard to do two tasks at the same time, so let's give up one."" However, I persuaded each of the team members and planted enthusiasm and motivation, ""Nevertheless, we can do it."" As a result of carrying out these two projects, I was able to receive two excellence awards at the end of the year. #Doing My Best When I first set up a team, I was very troubled because there was no server developer. I took the position of server developer with the responsibility to lead the team as a team leader. I had a hard time building, developing, and managing a server development environment through Linux books and Googling, but it was an opportunity to learn a lot about servers."",""""#If the user conveniently chose the company as a 'business' by leading the team through the code I wrote, I launched a service called '&'.

"IT technology is at the center of the rapidly changing world. It is not an exaggeration to say that the future direction depends on the hands of those who deal with IT technology. LG CNS's actions to provide services to diverse customers based on these technologies are also the company that I will be with in the future. I believe that the logical thinking skills through mathematics, problem solving skills, and internship experience at a financial institution are essential experiences in developing a finance solution that LG CNS is leading. Through Python programming experience, I was able to find efficient and simple algorithms to achieve results, and also find appropriate libraries to write applicable codes for other fields. This has firmly established the need for programming and software, which is the biggest reason why I applied to LG CNS. While working as an intern at a global asset management solution company, I participated in the development of fund products that can yield absolute returns based on data from overseas funds. It was also very important to set up sophisticated algorithms because we needed data from all funds in the world to find information, and we had to be competitive under any circumstances. I was able to easily obtain the data by crawling the past 15 years' worth of data using Python, and also visualizing it to represent the trend of 1,890 funds over time. I also applied this code to create a foundation that can be applied to fields such as bonds, real estate, and derivatives. After these efforts, we successfully developed the product and received nearly 10 billion won in investment within two months of its launch. In the process, we were able to develop our work skills through programming.""""The next-generation financial system market, which began with the Fourth Industrial Revolution, is approaching our eyes. Based on Internet banks and fintech, the existing financial system is changing, and the role of LG CNS is becoming more important than anything else by introducing blockchain and new security solutions. I am trying to create a financial solution within LG CNS that leads to innovation in the financial business. With my experience in school education and asset management, I gained core knowledge of Banking and Finance, dealt with Big Data while working at an asset management solution company, and was able to provide Information & Analytics to our customers through Real-time Risk Mgmt. In the future, we intend to develop a new platform based on this domain knowledge in the next-generation channel and become a talented person who leads the LG CNS that leads the change in the global market, not a leader in Korea."",,,,"
"While I was reading a C/C++ book after I was discharged from the military, I suddenly came up with the idea of a group chat app. I wanted to develop a program that could provide real services other than a school assignment, so I didn't want to make it to a level that simply functions. But the problem was that I could only do C. But I didn't hesitate to start. When I was developing Android, I wandered around for a long time not knowing why the relay server wasn't connecting, and I had to learn Photoshop and Nine Patches so that the UI could respond to different resolutions. It took me a long time to write a simple query for the DB, and so did designing the communication protocol between the server and the client. Since most of the things I did for the first time, the progress was very slow due to different trials and errors. However, the more I developed it, the faster I developed it, and I didn't have a hard time thinking of making the apps I had imagined. Eventually, after developing steadily for about five months, I was able to complete an app called D-Note. The experience of working day and night at that time became the basis of my ability today, and it was a great help in working on future projects. So now I know that when a problem arises, even if it's a little bit difficult right now, if you try to solve it in the end, you will improve your skills and satisfaction with the amount of time you put into it. This was the foundation of my personality to be proactive in dealing with any issues that arise between developments."" ""This is one of my two things that I was solving now!"" That's what I used to say half-jokingly when I was on the intranet team, when I was asked if my coworkers were not going to bed. That's how passionate and persistent I am that when an issue arises, I can't rest peacefully without solving it. I had this characteristic because I enjoyed the series of processes of trying different ways and eventually finding the cause of the problem and solving it. Rather than just a one-dimensional solution to the problem, I tried to track and solve the issues that were even a little suspicious or open to improvement. So, when I tried to piece together puzzles one by one, analyzing sources one by one, looking for where the problem was, or asking for help from a reference or community, I'd forget to sleep until late at night and get into the problem. As a result, I developed a broader and more solid foundation and ability to cope with exceptions. Those experiences have come together to create who I am today, and have greatly influenced my belief that any problem can be solved with perseverance and effort. I still have that mindset unchanged, and I am confident that I will overcome any obstacles with my passion and perseverance. However, because of the personality of being immersed in one field, I couldn't afford to do other favorite things. I also liked activities such as singing and leisure, but I often just kept thinking, 'I'm going to do what I'm busy now and then.' These days, I am making an effort not only to develop, but also to have a more relaxed personality. This is because I think I can live as a developer for a long time only when I have a healthy mind to support me.""'The closest software to people and Nexon' game are one of the closest software to people. Most people, regardless of age or sex, love games. As one of them, I also love games so much that when I was working on a project at school, I used to make mostly games. I made a snake game for two in my Android class and an airplane game in my openGL class. The game was always well received and the professor liked it. So, whenever I was making simple games, I often thought that I wanted to work in a field related to games. It is because making software that users like is a lot of fun as a developer. So, I thought of Nexon. It is because I have developed the games that I enjoyed the most from the user's point of view. These are the games I played with my childhood, such as Illancia, the Land of the Wind, and the Mabinogi Heroics, and Nexon that developed them is a company that will make software, or games, that will continue to entertain users as it used to be. With Nexon, which has decades of development know-how and publishing skills, I thought that it was a company that I could grow with and apply. 'Not a computer engineering student, but a developer.' I wanted to become a developer. However, theory classes in my second year of college were not enough to satisfy my curiosity. So, I always thought about what I could do now and actively tried to find opportunities. As a result, I was able to get two years of training from another company, challenge ACM-ICPC every winter to evaluate algorithmic performance, and a 700-member intranet management team had more than a year of experience in operation and development. Since I dreamed of becoming a developer, I have worked hard to become a developer, not a computer engineering student. As a result, I believe I have been able to design programs from my user's point of view, take initiative in projects, and play my role as a responsible developer. Now I truly want to move away from being a student and grow into a developer of Nexon.""1. Detailed analysis of asynchronous servers 2. Development of websites with dynamic design elements, rather than static ones, I am largely interested in the above two topics. First, I would like to take a closer look at asynchronous servers. Having only known about traditional synchronous servers, the way the event-based asynchronous server works has been shocking. It works like a multi-thread, while breaking down what needs to be done into pieces and processing them into one thread to solve problems with shared resources. I haven't studied more deeply, but if I have a chance, it's a topic I'd like to study. Second, I'd like to develop a website with dynamic design elements.I've developed promotional sites for other companies in the past, but I've used items such as parallax scrolling and responsive web partly due to limited time and resources. The project ended successfully, but I'm sorry that it was limited, so I'd like to create a dynamic site that will surprise users when I have the opportunity. And I'm hoping to record experiences on these issues well in the near future and do IT technology blogs, lectures, and book publications. That's because I want to show my juniors that experience as I have seen your knowledge over their shoulders on the Internet or in books. It still feels like a long way off, but I'm preparing for that day again."" [CasOnline] ""Because of the nature of FPS games where one person has to kill one person and one person has to kill one death, I think CasOnline has provided an interesting game mode for everyone through zombie mode. I was able to play games happily without paying much attention to the death of either human or zombie characters. So it's easy to bicker with your friends when you play FPS or Daejeon games, but we had fun together with Cas Online. [Ilancia] It's an RPG game that I've enjoyed for a long time with its unique elements of ability that build up skills little by little if you use it often, magic and items that give it a mysterious feeling as it is hard to get, and beautiful BGM. As it becomes Nexon's classic RPG, I still maintain the same image as I did in my childhood, so I can play it with nostalgia. It was a fun game with a very simple but thrilling feeling of manipulation with the same atmosphere as a historical drama [Land of the Wind]. There is no reason, but I always remember that I chose Goguryeo and grew many different jobs. I still remember hunting squirrels as I remembered the land of the wind when I met them in the mountains. It was a game where I was so curious about how they realized it while playing [FIFA Online]. I'm in awe whenever I play a realistic soccer game based on discrete figures expressing the players' abilities and hidden statistics. If I ever join Nexon, I would like to visit the spearhead team and ask them about the structure of FIFA Online. [Mabinogi Heroics match] It was the perfect game for me, who valued manipulation. I played as a Fiona character, and the combination of sound and screen effects made the hit feel great. It was amazing how it delivered a realistic, vivid feeling while asking for relatively low points. The story line from the beginning was also exciting, so I had fun playing it."",,,"
"[Benefit: I gained trust after finishing the organization] ""10/5/5"" is the number of part-time jobs, outside activities, and volunteer activities that I participated in. My face was always on the final photo after the 20 activities were over. I had never quit before the promised work period, and I had never let my team members suffer by dropping out under the pretext of personal circumstances in team project activities. Although the contract period is over this spring, there was a shoe store owner who called, and last winter, there was a junior who sent me a letter of gratitude for actively participating in the discussion club activities. I did my job to the end, and did not mind what others were reluctant to do. Then, I naturally gained the trust of people around me, which remained a great asset for me. ""In fact, it would be natural for a person in society to gain trust in a responsible attitude."" However, I wanted to remind myself that the value of trust will shine greatly in the Nexon Networks game service job. It is because it is a virtue that should be equipped first due to the nature of the work that requires constant communication with customers. [Experience: A salesperson at a department store who developed ""observation""] I worked a short-term part-time job in oral sales for 6 months at a department store. The game industry and the distribution industry are different, but there is a common denominator of customers. Beyond simply selling them, we have predicted and observed customer movement and demand for sales according to the season's specialties. We have also rearranged product DP accordingly and tried to help customers as much as possible for their convenience. I am confident that this has made our customers step closer to each other. Just as we did our best in real-time sales, rather than helping them post-mortem, we will become diligent observers at Nexon Networks. ((=) We prepared in advance the demand for changes in the season through observation, and tried to increase sales through real-time understanding of customer movement. If the management team takes charge of a game as well, I think it is possible to solve the problem as soon as possible through preliminary preparation for the launch of an event or a newly released game, and quick reporting on an issue that explodes in real-time.) [Professional: Problem Analysis - Suggestion for Alternative -> A sense of number and thinking] I thought about how a public administration major would be helpful for the game service job. Due to the nature of my major, I performed tasks that required me to solve social phenomena that became issues from a neutral standpoint as much as possible. I developed an eye for even the smallest issues from a broader perspective by seeing stakeholders who have a single problem. In addition, while taking a statistics lecture, I went out to the field and surveyed the field in person, and calculated objective numbers through the SPSS program. I also acquired basic OA programs and accounting-related certificates to cultivate a sense of number,"" I learned a lot from ""3 beats for mind, communication, thoughtfulness and game service jobs."" I encountered a lot of ""problems and requirements at each level"" that arise when dealing with people of all ages while working part-time and doing outside activities. Whenever that happened, I did my best to help them within my competence and developed a basic Mind for service jobs. In addition, while running a blog, I participated in ""ooooooo festival.ooooo oo city social media red rather than red"" and during that period, I served as a communication channel to give feedback on information and inquiries the other person needed. Lastly, I am meticulous and careful in everything. Currently, I'm working at an accounting firm as a part-time job in due diligence on bonds, but there are always variables and I have to approach them differently in different situations. Whenever that happens, I take notes of changes on A4 paper and come home to edit existing files by word process. In the next task, I'm trying to master it quickly without getting confused while watching it. I decided that I could finish my game service job at Nexon Networks with these three beats combined. [I want to represent the hearts of all users] - The primary goal is that as IT technology advances, the trend shifts from online games to mobile games, and game users' 'one-time consumption tendency' is intensifying. It seems that the number of migratory birds is increasing and there are many people who are silent. Customers who demand complaints through email and community bulletin boards can be resolved. However, the majority of users who are below the tip of the iceberg who are turning their backs on games are even scarier. Couples who have separated from diving often do not know why, so they do not know what to fix. If I join the company in the future, I will become a versatile talent who manages expected threats along with the problems that have surfaced. [For better CRM and game system improvement] - I want to adapt to the secondary goal task to some extent and then continue to develop myself to become a professional. On Facebook, promotional activities of LG Marketing Team and Busan Police Station are being reproduced and spread with FUN elements, making them approach consumers in a friendly manner. This enhances promotional effects and brings a positive brand image. The game industry also has many activities in the IT space as its major targets are many young people in their teens and 30s. I want to study more and more ""instant"" and ""going to be swaggy"" customer care that suits them. [K-GAME Service Expert] - Third goal The final goal is to become K-GAME's service expert. I remember when I was in high school, I was so into Card Rider and prepared for a competition at a PC room with the money for a reading room. At that time, I would have simply pursued joy, but now I have grown into a young man who knows the high added value of the game industry. As an IT powerhouse, I am confident that games are a leading industry that will lead the future more than any other field, and Nexon's games are always leaders. In 20 years, we will grow into a specialist who can comprehensively control the service sector of K-GAME, which will lead the world, and achieve self-realization.I once served as an assistant at the Joseon Education admission briefing session. As the enthusiasm for the entrance examination was high, so was the enthusiasm of the parents. One day, a mother suddenly became angry and asked me to take out her notebooks and writing instruments that she had written down because they fell between the folding chairs in the auditorium. When I looked into why she was suddenly angry, a female employee responded that she had no choice because it was the customer's mistake. An angry customer suddenly came to me and asked me to take it out, asking if I was in charge of you. Although I was a simple sub, I felt like I should take action to make my parents feel better. I tried to take it out on my stomach even though I put my hand in the middle of the chair, but it didn't work. So I found the phone number of the facility management team in the auditorium hall and contacted them, and the facility manager told me that he was coming in about an hour. An hour later, the facility manager arrived and we were able to return the supplies safely through the back door opening. After that, I persuaded him by saying, ""The facility management is not under our jurisdiction, but we apologize for the inconvenience caused."" I was able to succeed in unraveling my parents' feelings by showing them an effort to act in person, not just by words. [Eating with a friend from 2PM?] What help do you need to understand the other person's feelings? I had a great experience to take a step closer. Last winter, I met my middle school classmate by chance at the library. While talking about this and that, I found out that I was preparing for a police officer, and I had a hard time because I went to bed three times. He said that he had eaten alone without using KakaoTalk for a year and a half, so I asked him to eat with me starting tomorrow. Then, I felt lonely and bored, but I thanked him and laughed happily. During the two-month winter vacation, we became good friends who we could always rely on while having lunch at 2 p.m., and my friend got a Kakao message saying that she would buy a meal this fall as she passed the examination only after passing the examination. Through the above two experiences, I learned to understand exactly what was required and to treat customers like family, and I want to show off at Nexon Networks."","" [Relieving friends' betrayal] - I hope only to live a conversation There is a group of five awkward friends who have been together since middle and high school. I started drinking when I was 20, and my friend A lost his mind when he drank, and my friend B was good at mischief. Usually, when we paid together, we all did 1/N, but one day, we drank a lot and B took an additional 10,000 won out of friend A's wallet, saying, ""Didn't you ever not?"" A few days passed after that, and suddenly, friend A left the KakaoTalk room and there was no answer. I was angry that friend C told me the whole story of the incident and he didn't tell me. When I saw the act of losing money, I also didn't pay much attention to it as usual without conveying the fact correctly. Eventually, B and I became dissatisfied with C, who exaggerated the incident and wanted to resolve it quickly with A, who got angry. We met in person and talked about our stories because we couldn't convey a proper explanation of the situation and sincerity over the phone. It was difficult to apologize because we were so close, and it was awkward to make eye contact with each other, but I decided that it was a must-go process. A week later, everyone reconciled again, and now the conflict has not arisen because they have learned more about each other's characteristics since then. The way to overcome this conflict is 1. Confronting each other 2. Conversation. Why would they not understand each other's feelings again this time? If there had been no conflict, there would have been no gathering to plan a summer trip. Conflicts often arise because of the number of people who are in charge of data research without presentation while working on group assignments during school days, and at this time, they confront and talk even if they are uncomfortable for the team's success. It's easy to say, but I think there are many conflicts because everyone is reluctant and doesn't want to do it. I want to become a humane game service manager who can hide far away and run into each other unconditionally without doing mechanical work."""
"I have the experience of creating a 'similar torrent program' as a task for the computer network, which is an undergraduate class. The assignment was to create a 'file transfer program', but the assignment was set on a relative evaluation based on the function and completeness of the program, so I decided to develop a torrent program, not a simple file transfer program. In order to develop the program, it was necessary to learn many things such as Torrent's file distribution principle, understanding file processing, understanding transmission protocols, and threads. Most basically, I studied the file transfer method used by the Torrent program. Torrent divided files into equal-sized pieces, collected each piece through sharing between users, and merged the pieces back into one file. In order to use this method, we learned how to process files by dividing them into equal-sized pieces. In addition, since the program exchanges files between multiple users rather than two users, it acquired the knowledge of multiple threads to exchange files with multiple users at the same time. In addition, I learned various knowledge by creating the program, such as file transfer using Java and understanding the transport protocol. It was a tight time to acquire knowledge and develop a program within the submission deadline, but in the end, I successfully developed a similar torrent program and achieved a good grade of No. 1 on the project. ""[I have to solve the problem] I developed a chat program using the COM port for my undergraduate project. At that time, I was given a code to send packets, but if I used it as it was, the latter part of the message would not be cut off. The code was given as it was, so it didn't affect the task score, but I analyzed the cause to solve this problem. The problem occurred because of the speed difference between SW and HW, and I solved the problem by delaying the transmission of messages to solve it. In the end, I was the only one to solve the problem and get a good grade called A+. As such, I will not miss any minor problems, so that no problems will arise in the future. [Not being detailed] I am not very delicate. This has led me to spend a lot of time debugging due to minor typos or grammar mistakes, and I didn't read assignments carefully, so I developed the program all over again in the past. To overcome this, I have made my own habit. I set a coding method and tried to follow it. Every time I wrote a line, I checked for typos and made sure the grammar was not wrong. In the planning stage, I carefully organized what needed to be developed and tried to reduce time waste as much as possible by designing algorithms in advance. As a result, debugging time was significantly reduced, and I developed a high-quality program through meticulous program design.""""[Dreaming of a Happy Society with Customers] I was fascinated by the corporate mindset of Dongbu Fire & Marine Insurance and applied.""

As a member of Dongbu Fire & Marine Insurance, I will strive to create a happy society with my customers. [? ?] I think this idiom, which everyone knows is also applied to software development.

I want to make sure that no one knows our IT department exists. [World Travel] I want to travel to all countries in the world.

I am the type to prepare thoroughly so that everything goes smoothly. Everything for the job is prepared in advance, and when you are actually working, you are thoroughly prepared to use what is prepared right away so that there are no disruptions. An information system organization is a department that provides a stable IT environment to other departments. This requires the development of stable systems and quick action and maintenance according to the changing environment.

During my undergraduate years, I developed a music playback app and chat program that focused on intuitive interface. I received feedback from users of my same type of app and reflected it in the interface development, and after all, my parents, who are not familiar with machines, are also using the app I developed themselves.

In order to solve this problem, I suggested a method of searching by reducing the difference in the range of sequence values through normalization in the preprocessing stage, and the professor recognized the validity of the idea and even wrote a graduation paper. Through this, I gained confidence to see that my ideas actually worked through verification and experimentation.

I used APM (Apache, PHP, MySQL) to build a shopping mall. The implementation contents included membership system (member registration, login, logout, member withdrawal, information modification), manager system (member management and product management), and DB related to products and members. As an intern, I had no web-related experience, so I couldn't understand the web at all, such as how the page works between the server and the client, so I had a lot of difficulties that the big picture was not drawn in the initial planning stage of the project. I learned basic web languages such as PHP and HTML necessary for web development, and learned how the web works through online courses and books. I couldn't understand the non-kinetic characteristics of PHP, so I ended up completing the project successfully through a lot of performance and error. Through this project, I came to understand how the web works, DB, and web language. [Mentoring] When I was an undergraduate, I participated in various mentoring programs as a mentor.Since I was young, I have fixed my acquaintances' computers and felt that many people could not use the services that computers provide properly. Therefore, I thought that it would be good for anyone who is not a non-majors to use computers easily, which led to various mentoring activities during my undergraduate years. I participated as a mentor in various programs such as mentoring younger students in the department, mentoring SCSC (non-majors software) courses, and mentoring foreign students. It was rewarding to think that more people would be able to benefit from computers if I worked as a mentor and let them know my knowledge and develop better software."""
"[My Life's Man-Turn] I served as an Air Force communications officer, and I monitored intrusion and error of the military's internal network in real time, and I always felt responsible. While serving in the military, I received news that major broadcasting companies and financial computer networks had been hit by a cyber terror attack on March 20, 2013. After hearing this news, I realized the importance of security once again, and I thought that if there was a security problem, even high-quality technologies could be useless. Through this opportunity, I made a commitment to become one of the people in charge of security in the Republic of Korea. With this commitment, I eagerly took various courses such as HW, SW, and Network while undergraduate school. Among them, the part that I was fascinated by was Network, which made it easier for us to communicate and enjoy convenient life. I studied more about Network and learned various technologies, and based on these technologies, I applied to AhnLab, which can contribute to security through control. When selecting a company that is another starting point in my life, I think about whether it is a company that can sustainably grow, rather than looking at the current situation. In this regard, AhnLab continues to strive not only for computer security, but also for the security of the latest technologies such as mobile, financial information, and IoT. I am confident that this development of technologies for new things is conclusive evidence that customer satisfaction is a top priority, not just profit-seeking. I thought we could work together toward the common goal of maximizing customer satisfaction. I will be one of the AhnLab members who will help us all live in a freer world by ensuring security in the control field I am in charge of. [AnLab which practices 'we' values] I have considered my colleagues and team importantly and have a big consideration when selecting a company. I applied to AnLab because he practices the 'we' values I pursue directly through a bottom-up method of collecting and discussing opinions from colleagues. When a road was disrupted by heavy rain during the long journey of bicycle land, I have the experience of safely moving to the destination by finding alternatives to meet the schedule with the members. In the summer of 2014, I went on a long journey of about 700 kilometers from Haenam to Seoul for seven nights and eight days via the national highway rather than by bicycle. During the long journey, a heavy downpour caused the road to collapse. As a result, I was unable to safely travel to the accommodations I had reserved, and all the colleagues started to tremble. I spent the day safely with some of the staff, visited the area where I could proceed with the next schedule, and fortunately, I decided to receive accommodation from a nearby cathedral on condition of cleaning up. In addition, other colleagues contacted me in advance, and even a patrol car was recruited so that I could proceed safely with the next schedule. Although I felt heavier while running around looking for a solution, I felt lighthearted because I felt that we were able to proceed without anyone getting hurt thanks to all of our efforts. I want to be a member of the AhnLab, where we, rather than one person, join forces to solve the problem."" [Verified Human Resources Developed at AhnLab] I am the first to have the strength of being meticulous and meticulous, which is appropriate for security activities. When I was a college student, I worked on a project with Raspberry Pi in an Internet communication design class. The theme of our team was the 'library seat system'. It is not just an imitation of the current library system, but a led notification function that informs users of the end time of the seat and a web seat management function have been added. At first, I thought that we could draw and synthesize the results for each part, so we performed coding work separately. When I combined the coding I was in charge of with the coding that the other team members brought, I confirmed that there were many errors because the parts were not harmonized. Perhaps due to repeated errors, all of the team members were tired. However, I completed a project as a team leader, divided the connection part of coding into n equal parts for the team's good performance, and analyzed the coding in detail in the parts we were in charge of each other. We analyzed the coding we were in charge of one by one, and organized the contents of errors, so the system was able to complete the project as it worked normally. Through this project, I could feel that I had to carefully check and analyze every 'dot' for IT work. The second is that I have known and done the synergy of teamwork that can maximize work efficiency. In my fourth year of undergraduate, I had the experience of disassembling the door lock with interest in the components of electronic products that I use on a daily basis, and implementing the door lock directly with my classmates to learn more about the MCU that controls the system. Unlike general door locks, the position of the number changes each time a password is entered, so it is configured to strengthen security. The number is indicated as a segment, and a touch panel is trapped on the segment, and touch input is possible. At first, I had no idea how to print numbers on the segment and how to operate the touch panel, so I had to proceed with the project by searching for information one by one. I thought it would be more efficient to divide the project rather than study everything alone at once. Through meetings with team members, each of the topics of interest were assigned, and seminars in the areas of segment afterimage output, touch panel, and circuit diagram were conducted. Through a total of 11 seminars, all team members were able to understand the flow of the project, and finally, the door lock was locked. Cooperation does not necessarily take place when you become one, but it can create synergy if you clarify your role, even if it is in a dispersed state. Finally, the third strength is completion of education and certification for servers and networks.In order to improve my understanding of servers and networks and to practice them, I studied and completed the basic Linux, Windows Server management, and CCNA Network for about six months at an ITBANK private institute. I didn't stop at these training sessions, but opened my foothold as an expert by obtaining an information processor and CCNA certificate. Such strengths such as meticulousness, teamwork, professional education and certification will greatly help AnLab become a company responsible for security not only in Korea but also in the world.""???,,,"
"[Left and right: You can do it] My motto is 'You can do it.' This motto is 'You can do it' when I was in second grade, and I finally got the top spot in the team project in the Digital Logic Design course, which is my first major design course, and it became more deeply rooted in my perception. The process was by no means smooth, but as a team leader, I worked hard without giving up until the end. Usually, the subject of this course was the design of digital alarm clocks, but the task we were given was the design of a hexadecimal calculator. Because the hexadecimal system is a poorly used number system, I had to organize the logic of the calculation before the design, and I couldn't find any reference materials for making the calculator. I also couldn't get help from my seniors, and even if I had designed it my own way, there was no way to know if it was the right design. Eventually, all of the students were hardly able to proceed with the project and had to undergo negative evaluations. When the team members started to give up one by one, I, as the team leader, felt a sense of crisis. I put off my other tasks and devoted myself to the project, devouring it into books and the Internet, putting a lot of effort into it. It was a crude design through constant repetitive learning of basic principles, but I came up with the overall idea and worked together with my team members to share parts to complete the final result. I completed the design through several sleepovers and meetings, and I submitted the final report with a nervous mind. My group's project eventually won first place. After the results were announced, I was able to feel that I have taken a step further by gaining an indescribable sense of accomplishment, confidence in design, as well as a sense of responsibility, leadership, and perseverance. As a team leader, I learned how to inspire my team members, and I was able to unknowingly find myself feeling the responsibility of a leader and striving to accomplish it. Since then, I have felt that no matter how vague the situation comes, if I persevere and find a breakthrough, I can come close to success in anything."" [Thorough Service Spirit] After the university entrance announcement, I worked part-time at a donut store for about a year. Although the location and conditions were not very good, I was trusted by the manager for a year and received the highest urgency, and I realized a lot about the professional spirit of the service industry. At the time, it was my first time looking for a part-time job, and without much thought, I ended up working at a donut store an hour away from my home. Due to the nature of my job, all the part-timers except me were women, and I worked under a kind of territoriality and criticism. At first, I had complaints and thought about quitting, but because the manager was so kind, I held back and worked hard. Since donut stores are also a kind of service business, how to treat people kindly and respond wisely to customers' complaints were required, but more were required when demanding customers came to complain. However, most of the part-timers were 20-year-olds in society, and they were often unable to respond kindly to customers' rude or unfair demands. The store manager paid a lot of attention to word of mouth because it was in the center of numerous apartment complexes, and I couldn't stand by and watch. I quickly learned the task so that I could perform the role of serving customers first, and I suggested it to the part-timers. They would also be stressed when dealing with demanding customers, so if there was a problem with customer service, they would ask me to hand over the service. Since then, I have served a lot of dissatisfied customers and although I could never say it was a good time, I have received a lot of compliments from the manager for his consideration and his own principles. It is because the number of customers has increased, and the reputation of the store has been very good. It has been a rewarding experience for me because I could feel a lot about the spirit of the service industry and I have been treated well by the manager in return for his hard work."",""[Half Middle School Programmer] I have been exposed to computers since I was a child. Soon after, I became proficient in computers enough to take charge of computers in the house, and after gaining momentum, I bought a book when I was in middle school and challenged myself to learn the C language. Since I was a child, I liked to make things using a computer. At the time, my friends used computers to play games and listen to music, but I also used tools to make games using the mouse cursor, icons, or homepages. Then, I suddenly wondered what the source of various programs was, and while looking on the Internet, I learned about language C, which is the basis of programming. The friends around me had no idea of language C, and there was no one around me who could give me advice on language C, so I decided to teach myself recklessly. I decided to choose a recommended book on the Internet, bought a book, and started studying by following the example. However, language C did not feel easy for me as a middle school student. I was only familiar with the GUI, so I was at the level of understanding basic concepts and simple examples, such as simply outputting the results of the DOS screen even when solving examples and exercises, or it was difficult to approach the answer in principle. After finishing a book without direction, I thought about what I could do, and all I had left was 'Hello world'. I felt an unknown challenge and tried to get something by scanning the book again. After all, understanding about half of the book was my limit at the time, but it later became a solid foundation for me. When I went to the electronics department, I was able to get one step ahead of others in the SW field, where everyone was struggling, and I was able to catch both HW and SW."",""[Flipping back] I always have a habit of flipping thoughts once in a while.It's because I've frequently experienced unexpected and far better directions. For example, when I was working on a team project in a digital integrated circuit subject, I scored high in a different way than others. I was usually interested in this field, so I completed the team project much earlier than the deadline. When I finished the result report, the team members were no longer interested, but I thought, ""What if it's not completed as usual?"" Meanwhile, I discovered that my team's and other team's topics could converge. Our team's topic was to output RGB data received through the camera module, and among the other team's topics, to adjust the pixel data through coding and display a picture on the monitor. By combining these two, we came up with the idea of connecting RGB data to the input of VGA Control and outputting the image from the camera to the monitor. As the team had already completed the project, I proposed a collaboration, and the two teams combined the topics to work on a new additional project. Although the difficulty of both topics was so difficult that we were unable to complete the original project due to time and technical constraints, we succeeded in printing out RGB data in color on our monitors. After our team's presentation on the day of the assignment, we announced about additional projects. Because we were the only team that worked on additional projects, not only the students but also the professors were surprised. After the presentation was over, the professor said this is a case in point. In the end, both teams received the highest marks in the project section and completed the course with high grades. This was the most gratifying and meaningful thing that I have achieved by the habit of reversing thoughts in the opinion of the majority.""""[Almighty engineer on the principle of communication and consideration] My most important values are communication and consideration, and my dream is to be an omnipotent engineer who can do anything well. I have always worked hard to achieve these two goals, not only in my studies but also in my life. In order to experience the corporate culture that I have not experienced in person, I have experienced a sense of belonging by working on card inspection and documentation for about a month in the R&D team of Korea Smart Card. I mainly performed frequency and non-destructive inspection and documentation work. In addition, during vacation, I learned how to use the tool and basic knowledge by receiving PCB design training using Cadence's tools. I have tried to develop both hardware and software skills. Through various classes in the curriculum, I have developed my ability to handle MCUs skillfully, not only understand simple codes but also code to code programs, but also learn the roles of each MCU pin or how to use communication functions when necessary to enable various types of application coding. Using this, I also created a graduation work under the theme of 'Home Automation Using Zigbee Communication'. Within the team, I was in charge of designing the overall structure of the work, building a wireless communication network, coding, and circuit design of a control unit. In addition, I was passionate in related subjects and received high grades based on understanding, not memorization. My top priority is consideration and communication. I have always thought that the basis of a smooth human relationship comes from consideration and communication, and I believe that it has a positive effect on everything. Based on these, I would like to contribute a lot to the path to becoming an SK C&C that is second to none in the world by becoming an engineer who promotes innovation and leap forward without falling behind the technological changes that are developing day by day. I am also confident that I will develop a sense of affinity and cooperation to lead a smooth company life, improve efficiency, and work with a mindset appropriate for new employees."",,,,"
"""To become the subject of autonomous driving SW development"" As a company specializing in vehicle infotainment, Hyundai M&Soft is leading the industry with its unrivaled technology, especially in the field of self-driving map solutions. In order to become a developer of self-driving SW based on image recognition, I want to grow by inheriting Hyundai M&Soft's advanced technology and infrastructure. When I heard the news of the emergence of ResNet during my undergraduate years, I thought that deep learning-based image recognition could replace human vision in the future, and I became interested in self-driving SW. In order to study the capabilities necessary for self-driving, such as object recognition, OCR, and sensor processing, I gained practical experience and learned technology. After joining the company, I would like to study the convergence technology using object recognition and sensor processing, and the technology that still has room for improvement, such as OCR technology for more precise recognition. Through this, I will become an expert who contributes to the performance improvement and advancement of SW technology so that I can complete five stages of autonomous driving beyond ADAS,"" said the undergraduate school participated in the ICT competition ""Traditional Image Processing and Computer Vision Knowledge"" and carried out the augmented reality RC car project using Raspberry Pi. I was mainly responsible for object recognition using OpenCV and developing driving evaluation logic. I was not familiar with it because it was my first time to develop object recognition while dealing with hardware including camera modules. To overcome this, I spent as much time as possible to understand the hardware and analyze open sources to understand the technology. We implemented object recognition of lanes, traffic lights, and signs using Hough transform and Contour, and implemented driving evaluation logic by mapping sensor values. I completed the project with the bronze prize in the contest and the silver prize in the academic conference. Understanding the traditional theory of object recognition from the preprocessing process of camera input images enabled me to have faster understanding and flexible implementation ability in deep learning-based development. ""AI modeling technology for performance improvement"" The ability to implement image recognition SW logic is important, but I thought it was also important to understand deep learning and improve AI model performance itself. I participated in a competition to compete for model ranking on a real-time ranking board to increase my AI modeling ability. We performed a classification task using a shopping review image mixed with unbalanced labels and noise and a category text dataset. Since it was difficult to solve the incomplete dataset only by algorithmic approach, we planned to solve the problem step by step by reading various papers, combining the necessary technologies. Over sampling alleviated the data imbalance, and the generalization of noise data was suppressed by the calculation of the label smoothing loss. Since then, we have utilized self-training for the purpose of building a completely refined dataset and improved the performance with the Ensemble technique. By creating a model that improved the baseline F1-score from 0.46 to 0.87, we won second place in the competition and acquired technical capabilities for the performance improvement strategy of deep learning-based recognition models."",""""Vehicle license plate OCR"" ??? In order to gain practical experience during the master's course and background in performance, a video device manufacturing company developed the license plate OCR as freelancer. The project aimed to develop a real-time vehicle license plate OCR that can recognize even changes in illumination or location and install it as a low-power embedded board. OCR logic is largely divided into two parts, which consist of localization for license plate area and registration for text. ??? I was in charge of developing Recognition for my role characters. ??? Derivation and Solution of the problem Due to the limitations of the low-power embedded board, performance degradation occurred when localization, which was implemented in the traditional way, presented noise data as the input value of the Recognition model. By analyzing the input noise, we found out that there are two main types, and we implemented Animal detection for removal. The first is when the entire input data is noise due to a localization error. To solve this problem from the perspective of Classification, noise data were collected, and normal character classes and noise classes were simultaneously learned as one model as learning data. Unlike characters with similar characteristics, it was possible to effectively classify noise inputs with features that were not generalized. The second is when localization is normal, but some of the input data is noise due to a segmentation error. In many cases, when the entire segmentation is shifted to the left or right, it is corrected to a normal value. Therefore, we have implemented to compare the shift calculated data with the predicted data of other frames to find a normal value and derive the noise-removed Inference through Ensemble. ??? As a result, we developed a system with a performance of 0.88 compared to the existing in-house license plate OCR system Accuracy 0.6 and completed the project, and published a KCI paper based on the research contents."",,,,"
"When I was undergraduate, I was interested in artificial intelligence using image recognition technology when I heard the news of the emergence of ResNet, which transcends the recognition rate of human sight. Among them, I thought that the key to lead the era of the 4th industrial revolution was autonomous driving. Mando's autonomous driving technology is moving toward full autonomous driving beyond ADAS by developing recognition, judgment, and control algorithms that combine different data such as sensors and images. Self-driving can be applied not only to automobiles but also to unmanned vehicles such as drones and AGVs. I supported Mando's infinite possibilities in developing autonomous driving with high ripple effects with its outstanding own technology. During my studies, I conducted industry-academia research by utilizing object detection/recognition/tracking, which is a deep learning-based recognition technology, and embedded S/W development capabilities. We have developed the ability to logically approach the attitude of project collaboration and deep learning issues and to implement the platform through the underlying technology. Through this, when the era of the 4th industrial revolution arrives, we will not simply be users who receive autonomous driving services, but developers who lead social values through independent implementation. We created a deep learning model for automatic image classification of ""Automatic Shopping Review Image Classification."" We won second place in the AI RUSH 2020 competition, creating a model that improved the baseline F1-score from 0.46 to 0.87. ""Car license plate recognition algorithm porting on SoC boards"" Algorithm for software operation was transplanted from lightweight embedded boards. Based on the implementation, we published it as a KCI paper. ""Development of ""Car license plate recognition SW"" real-time license plate OCR system was developed. We successfully completed the pre-stage development for the construction of the baseline and signed an extension contract through industry-academia research on campus. The performance improved to 0.88 compared to the in-house LPR system Accuracy 0.6. ""Automatic programming for web applications"" We developed an automatic web application generation platform based on sketch images. It succeeded in TTA certification and patent registration, and published a KCI paper after receiving the Best Paper Award at the Korea Computer Science Conference. ""We developed a VR/AR RC car that sets driving records on the model road of the ""augmented reality RC car using Raspberry Pi."" We won the bronze medal by ranking 7th out of 430 teams in the OOO ICT contest, and we received the silver prize by publishing a thesis at an academic conference.""""Growth towards self-driving development experts"" I will become an expert who provides solution design and implementation for self-driving services with image recognition technology based on deep learning and convergence technology using sensor data. I will grow through two activities after joining the company to achieve my goal. First, I will always research new technologies with an active attitude and take the lead in realizing high-tech skills by using them in practice. I believe that self-driving can only implement flexible technologies in a rapidly changing environment by constantly applying the latest technologies. We will review at least two papers every month, attend seminars related to artificial intelligence from time to time, and apply new technology capabilities to the field. Second, we will create an environment that grows together and create synergy. During my master's course, I presented the project implementation as a thesis and exchanged knowledge to grow. Even after joining the company, I will always think about improvements in the project with my team and create an environment to exchange acquired knowledge through academic meetings. Through this, we will contribute to achieving results with higher technological prowess. I am sure that the two activities that I will practice after joining the company will be important foundations for achieving my goals. Along with Mando, I will become an expert who researches advanced technologies and leads the development of autonomous driving. ""Automatic classification of shopping review images, 20.07.13~20.08.27"" As an intern at OOO, I performed multimodal classification using CNN and category metadata with shopping review image database mixed with unbalanced label and noise data. To create a noise robust model, we applied Label smoothing and built a clean dataset using Self-training. For multimodal learning, we designed an embedded layer that can learn information of metadata. In the final stage, we built several models with different network structures and applied Stacking ensemble to increase the performance. Based on the thesis, we were able to implement the technology and develop our ability to solve problems. """"Porting vehicle license plate recognition algorithm on SoC boards, 19.06.24~20.02.23"""" This is an industry-academia study with the support of OOOOOOO. With the aim of installing license plate recognition software on the low-power embedded board Hi3519A, we have transplanted a system implemented with Python language and Keras framework into C language and Caffe framework. For embedded boards that require less computation and efficient structure, the network has been redesigned based on lightweight deep learning algorithms. To prevent noise-induced performance degradation among real-time input data, Self-Training, one of the Semi-Supervisored Learning technologies, was used to implement anomaly detection and increase accuracy to suppress noise input. We have developed the ability to implement programs to be commercialized while coping with detailed requirements and bugs."""" Vehicle license plate recognition SW development, 18.12.26~19.06.25"" We developed the license plate OCR system while working as a freelance developer at OOO, a video device manufacturing company. Regarding vehicle license plate text recognition, we focused on internalizing technologies that can be recognized in real time regardless of external matters such as location, time, and climate conditions. Localization data pre-processing and object recognition for OCR were implemented, and object tracking was implemented for distinguishing multiple license plate instances.In order to efficiently collect license plate data, we implemented a system that uses the Inference result of Confidence score that satisfies the threshold value among the results obtained from the RTSP image of road CCTV as learning data. The research alone was able to develop practical skills that were difficult to learn. ""Autoprogramming for web applications, 17.09.01~18.05.31"" Intelligent automatic programming technology was studied through industry-academic research with the support of OOOOO. The purpose was to provide high-quality web services through model-based code automatic generation technology, to eliminate errors by direct coding of developers, and to secure automated technology of test and debugging. To recognize the layout of a sketched web UI, we implemented a search algorithm by implementing pre-processing such as Edge Merge and Slope Filtering using Hough transform. We implemented an algorithm that detects web objects in the layout using deep learning-based object detection and automatically generates HTML codes that match the classified results. It was a good experience to proactively develop the overall deep learning platform backend. """"ARC cars using Raspberry Pi, 17.03.02~17.11.24"""" The project was carried out with an entrepreneurial mentor with the support of the OOO ICT contest organized by OOOOOOO. In order to operate the algorithm in embedded form, we built a server that can communicate with various sensors inside mobile and RC cars. We implemented object detection to recognize signs, traffic lights, and lanes, and an algorithm to evaluate driving scores using recognized values and various sensor data. It became an opportunity to learn the basics and hardware knowledge of traditional computer vision."",,,,"
"First of all, I became interested in Hyundai M&Soft because I have often heard the news that it is making generous investments in developing mobility connectivity and various mobility infotainment technologies as well as existing navigation solutions. Among them, I applied for the embedded S/W quality evaluation job because I thought it was consistent with the activities I had done so far. I have produced various results by winning the gold prize in the autonomous robot competition using the embedded system and the Defense Acquisition Program Administration Award in the thesis registration and start-up competition using bio-signals. As I mainly developed embedded SW, I learned that SW quality is important for sustainable growth. Therefore, I was able to encounter the theory by obtaining related certificates, and after joining the company, I would like to produce results that encompass engineering background knowledge and SW evaluation knowledge for the development and evaluation of embedded SW that ultimately satisfies customers. ""I have been mainly developing until I was interested in the quality evaluation of embedded SW, and I realized that the quality of SW is important for sustainable SW development based on this knowledge. Through this, in the second half of 2020, I gained expertise to perform my application job while making efforts to obtain related certificates. Previously, I mainly designed bio-signal systems through my experience as a researcher and intern in the lab for about a year in the medical engineering lab. Naturally, designing a SW-centered system was not easy as a mechanical engineering student. However, it was something I really wanted to do, and I knew that the future food would be a data analysis SW system, so I kept making the following efforts. First, I tried to get to know each other. In the undergraduate course, SW is only the basis of Matlab and C language, and it is also simple expression and number calculation. With the desire to take a leap forward, I went to the medical engineering lab in person to prepare for the test, and that's how I started my undergraduate research life. While learning a SW program separately from the professor, I analyzed and organized bio-signal data, assisted PhD students, and participated in numerous studies. When I was tired and lazy, I challenged myself to continue making steady efforts. Through the deep learning SW training held at OOOO in Korea, OOOO deep learning training, OOOO system training seminar, and participation in future connected car expert curriculum, I traveled around Busan, Seoul, Yeosu, and Gyeonggi-do during the semester to deal with various SWs. Based on the above efforts, I became an expert in preparing for a start-up with wearable device design along with one paper registration. Based on this SW engineering knowledge, I acquired a certificate related to SW quality evaluation and learned how to constantly strive to catch up even in the first field. Experience in testing and analyzing bio-signal data while interning at OOOO. The challenge was to develop a high level of bio-signal data measurement process and secure reliability. At first, I chose a green light source that everyone uses without thinking that errors could occur due to various environments, and I had never experienced errors due to motion noise, so I planned the test in a transmissive form. The results of the first experiment were also disastrous, and through undergraduate classes and thesis studies, we solved the technical problem by using red light rather than green light, evaluating it as a reflective type rather than a transmissive type, and adjusting the sampling rate considering the aliasing phenomenon. Considering the separation caused by movement in the sleep state and the resulting depth of light penetration, we chose a more rugged but stable RED light. In addition, the reason for changing the evaluation procedure to a reflective device was to minimize errors in motion noise. The above procedure was applied because it was predicted that the reliability of the measurement would be low because the gyro sensor was not used as a separate motion noise control filter. Finally, while learning the analysis know-how to minimize the aliasing phenomenon that occurs at a specific frequency through the adjustment of the sampling rate, we were able to obtain a meaningful value by acquiring RAW Data used in the project well."",,,,"
"Books influenced me a lot in the process of growth in forming a perspective on life and a personality. I continued to read various books on a wide range of subjects, and I was particularly interested in classical novels and Eastern and Western philosophy to explore them deeply. I was able to encounter the outstanding logic and reason of Greek philosophers through Western philosophies such as ""Crime and Punishment"" to understand and sympathize with various human images that I had not experienced, ""The Analects of Confucius"" to constantly learn, reflect on, and grow in a given environment, and ""Socrates' excuse."" As a result, I was able to understand the meaning of difficult documents by acquiring not only the attitude toward life but also the understanding and reading of language as I grew up with books, so I was able to easily grasp the meaning of difficult documents. I worked on many team projects at university, and was evaluated as a leading person by leading the team to success by always being the leader or presenter of the team. I think all of these achievements are the result of the humility, relationship-oriented lifestyle, and language proficiency that I gained through books during my past growth process, so my growth process was a period of time to lay the foundation for personality and attitude. Humanities literacy and the mindset to follow great men became the basis for leading myself to dream for society, including myself, in preparation for entering university. The person who had the greatest influence to have lifelong dreams is writer Lee Ji-sung. After watching his ""Dreaming Attic,"" I realized that by having a big dream, I was able to become a great man and eventually achieve that dream, so I was able to enter university with motivation. In addition, I developed life-essential apps as a software engineer and passionately challenged various SW field projects, which made me progress many times. I was selected as a software scholarship student and worked as an exchange student at OOO. In the process of working on more than 20 projects by directly applying the latest SW technologies, I gained knowledge of new SW technologies, English-based communication and teamwork, and especially the know-how to achieve project goals within a limited time. In the OOO SW competition finals, the first educational web app called ""OOOOOOOOO"" has been planned through a survey of elementary school teachers to complement the limitations of e-Learning Center and Clasting, which are elementary school education platforms, in the era of non-contact, and has been producing as a team project since the end of August. In addition, we are developing a web full stack that applies the Agile process and clean code, software architecture and DevOps in the OOO industry and capstone project, and realizing our dream to become a developer to provide optimal IT solutions to our customers. We derived management big data analysis solutions from global companies such as Amazon and Walmart, and studied meta feature extraction and AutoML at AI Research Institute Securayer. We are preparing a paper to study data analysis and visualization implementation capabilities in various domains, gain experience in field work, and study our own AutoML implementation through meta feature extraction. ""I was responsible for researching AI Research Institute Securayer to write a paper related to meta feature extraction technology. In the process, we also investigated in detail the technology that creates another AI with AI, called ""Automatic Machine Learning,"" which is based on the meta feature. I think this issue is important in that it accelerates the development of AI technology and increases the importance of domain knowledge in the future AI industry. The autoML technology derives the optimal AI algorithm based on the performance comparison of domain data from various fields learned and existing AI algorithm solutions for them. This is having a significant impact on the direction of the AI industry as it can replace some of the tasks of AI and data analysis experts. I think that Samsung SDS's Brightics AI can be further advanced by applying this AutoML technology, and in particular, SW and domain convergence talents are needed for the efficient and effective development of Analytics Intelligence, which leads to enterprise-optimized enterprise solutions. This is because SW and domain experts can teach AI the domain knowledge they have accumulated more efficiently and effectively. In the era of the 4th Industrial Revolution, Samsung SDS is focusing on enterprise solutions and five core technologies ??? AI, blockchain, cloud, big data analysis, and security ??? and AI is at the center. Considering that AI and IT companies' development patterns are proportional, Samsung SDS should have the best in-house autoML technology. And this autoML technology can maximize the value of the company while meeting the needs of various customers by deriving solutions across various domain fields. And the right person to learn domain knowledge from autoML is SW and domain convergence talents, so we should focus on nurturing and recruiting them."""" I applied to Samsung SDS because I can contribute to the development of Samsung SDS's corporate business support as a developer of MIS-based IT solutions. After grasping the target company's foundational MIS, especially ERP, and management and CRM, I am building up my capabilities to provide optimal AI and SW solutions for scientific and intelligentization of customer business by applying the optimal SW architecture and technology. Through the research and research of meta feature extraction technology for AutoML and the derivation of management big data analysis solutions at AI research institute Securayer, we have gained data analysis and visualization capability, and are preparing MFE and AutoML implementation papers. In addition, we are developing a web full stack in an industry project linked to LG CNS, a capstone project, and a team project that applies agile processes and clean codes, software architecture and DevOps used in the field at the Da Vinci SW Competition at Chung-Ang University.In conclusion, I applied because I was confident that I could contribute to Samsung SDS based on my management and SW expertise. I will provide optimal IT and AI solutions to companies at Samsung SDS. Regarding the development of enterprise solutions and IT technology solutions such as AI, cloud, and blockchain, I would like to share big data-based innovation and grow with the company."",,,,"
"As a management-based IT solution developer at KT DS, I will contribute to the development of Digital transformation, AICentro DL Studio, financial IT, and business solution support services.

Using Node and React, users will sign up and log in to participate in real-time chat rooms, make announcements, open small chat rooms, use of whispering function, and add video chat function afterward. In addition, I have experience leading the Capstone Project for six months at EPITH Paris. Based on my initial business plan of identifying users' mental state based on their heart rate and providing appropriate music accordingly, I gradually embodied the functions and design of the app with my team members. In addition, the team shared the vision that it would reduce users' daily stress, and faithfully performed each other's parts for six months. I was in charge of Arduino coding, UI development, heart rate analysis algorithm search and development, and completed an initial application called MusicMe, and was selected as A grade in recognition of the novelty of ideas and sincere process performance."",,,,"
"The ""Professional Communicator who also communicates with user logs"" IT job is to develop information systems such as BGF Retail's POS system so that merchants can efficiently perform sales operations. Without a computerized information system such as inventory management, ordering, and calculation at convenience stores, all tasks will be disrupted. IT personnel should always strive to improve user convenience beyond simply preventing errors from appearing in the system. To do this, it is necessary to be able to constantly communicate with users, understand their work, identify needs, and come up with improvement plans. To realize this, the attitude of communication that has been experienced while operating the system will be a great strength in performing tasks. There were time and physical limitations to always communicate directly with users while operating the system, so I developed a habit of checking the logs. While checking the logs, I found that the user repeated the same tasks at the same time. Accordingly, we conducted an interview and agreed on the user's inconvenience and suggested an RPA service that could solve it. By automating the work, we were able to improve customer discomfort and generate company profits. If we listen to not only direct communication but also indirect communication, we will contribute to the organization by discovering the needs of system users and resolving inconveniences. In the IT field, new technologies such as IoT, big data, and AI are constantly pouring out more than other fields. Just as CU opened a hybrid convenience store, we will constantly acquire and apply new technologies to create a store where people and technologies come together to put the convenience of customers and franchisees first by combining new technologies,"" and ""If we fail to communicate, we will go to the mountains."" I think the most important competency in achieving the common goal is communication skills. This is because a group cannot communicate well, just as there are many workers going to the mountains, just as a group goes to the mountains. As a grade representative, I believe communication is the center of collaboration, and I have experience in drawing consensus from student council groups. While planning the festival, even though we had a common goal of an unforgettable festival, we had difficulties due to differences in opinions of each department. The general affairs department failed to reach a consensus by raising profitability, the planning department by raising student interest, and the chairman and vice chairman by raising external aspects, and asked each department to present guidelines after sufficient meetings to resolve these issues. As a result of continuing to mediate opinions to hold events that are satisfactory to all, we were able to reach a consensus that students could be satisfied with within the budget. I think the reason why we have different opinions even within the same organization is that each person has different responsibilities. I will become an IT expert who develops, operates, and maintains the best services in BGF Retail by drawing consideration and communication from people from various positions. ""Winning the prize through unique presentation method through role play"" and ""RFID Technology"" were given a silver award for differentiated presentation method that introduced role play in technical report preparation and presentation competitions. In preparing for the presentation, I thought it would be difficult to understand after hearing only the presentation about the first technology I encountered, so I thought a lot about the presentation method using role play. After much thought, I suggested the presentation method using role play to my team members as a part of the parts needed for technology. However, the team members refused due to the fear of the presentation and the fact that it would take a long time to prepare. Therefore, I persuaded them by presenting the presentation in front of the team members once as a role play and once as a conventional presentation method, and I was able to get their consent. As a result, I was able to effectively understand the technology called RFID through my own differentiated presentation method. In addition, I was selected as a class representative and received a silver award by participating in a presentation competition hosted by the College of Engineering. Through these experiences, I was able to experience the importance of trying a creative approach and having a discriminatory competitiveness that is different from others. In addition, no matter what I do afterwards, I am trying to get better results by finding new ways without having any stereotypes."" ""Using mobile apps is an advantage, too many apps are a disadvantage,"" the CU convenience store app provides a reservation service. Recently, various convenience store foods have been introduced through the Pyeonstorang program, and products released through the Pyeonstorang program have the advantage of being easy to purchase through the app's reservation service. From the customer's point of view, the fact that they can purchase hot-talked-about products like the Honey Butter Chip fiasco has come as a big attraction in that they can buy them through the app without going in vain. On the other hand, I think it's a pity that there are too many CU-related apps such as Pocket CU, CU Convenience Store Delivery, and CU By-Self. This is because they would think that if they had to download three convenience store-related apps and use them even though they are not apps that they always use like messenger or SNS, they would unnecessarily use too much data and capacity. ""Focus on product R&D by reducing the cost of low value-added work"" Convenience stores usually use places that are close to them when they need something. However, in order to purchase hot-talked-about products such as Pyeonstorang products, they look for places that sell them, even if they are far away. I think developing and releasing a lot of hot-talked-about products like this is a way to increase the competitiveness of CU convenience stores. In order to reduce the cost of low value-added work and focus on high value-added work such as product R&D, it would be better to consider automating work through RPA instead of low value-added work. In addition, product research and development requires a lot of money to be invested. To cover these costs, IT jobs will need to consider introducing a cloud environment to reduce the cost of servers."",,,,"
"""Activity and the spirit of challenge nurtured in other countries."" When I was in the second grade of elementary school, I entered a local school in the U.S. without any English proficiency. There were only Asians in the school, and no one came forward to help. Everything, such as on-campus competitions and events, was a challenge, and I adapted by actively talking to my teachers and friends in poor English. This year's activeness that I have gained from other countries has allowed me not to be afraid of new challenges. People around me say that I am versatile, because I challenged myself even if I was not in a good field rather than because I was excellent at it. When there was no one who could do Photoshop or video editing, I took charge of it and learned video lectures, and based on my R skills, I learned various programs such as Python and VBA whenever I needed. Even though I was not a related major, I was the vice chairman of the Financial Engineering Association and actively showed interest in finance enough to achieve curriculum reform. This activeness can sometimes be a disadvantage. As there are many things I want to try, I sometimes cannot finish what I started because I am greedy for a limited amount of time. I took the time to go to China for a month to learn Chinese, but I almost couldn't take the English certification exam that I had planned. Taking this opportunity, I am practicing how to prioritize work and manage time leisurely and systematically so that I can carry out important work step by step. ""Leader who embraces everyone"" My experience in the U.S. became an asset, but I couldn't forget the feeling of being left alone at that time. I felt the big difference that a single helping hand made, so I developed a sense of value to be the one who gave that hand. I felt the duty to create an atmosphere in which everyone can participate without any alienated members, so I self-proclaimed myself as a mood maker and made efforts for unity. People around me recognized this and I was selected as a vice chairman by performing clubs and financial engineering societies, so I was able to create an inclusive atmosphere. ??? 2-1 Please explain what you think are the core competencies required to perform the job you applied for and why. ""Transmission and agility for business"" I want to become an asset management expert at Shinhan Bank. I think the key to this is the ability to transmit and quickness accompanied by expertise. When recommending a product or portfolio to a customer, you must be able to effectively convey the reason along with the evidence. This is because the customer must be able to intuitively understand it so that they can trust the asset management. Among the reviews on Robo-Advisor, I saw many opinions that the resulting algorithm was not reliable due to the lack of explanation. As such, it will become more important to easily explain and analyze customers' tendencies, markets, and past cases with manpower that cannot be digitally replaced. You also need the agility to respond to various requirements because you face a wide variety of customers. When faced with an unexpected situation, you should persuade your customers calmly rather than panicking. Work agility in acquiring and applying new knowledge and methods immediately is also important in accordance with the rapidly changing financial market. ??? 2-2. Please describe in detail what kind of effort you have made to acquire that capability. ""To become an omnipotent executive,"" I tried to acquire all kinds of capabilities, including expertise, delivery, and agility. Based on what I learned in the financial risk class, I worked as the vice chairman of the Financial Engineering Association and learned financial theory. Through lecture-style sessions, I taught the concepts to the academic members, and since many other students are new to finance, I have developed the ability to communicate easily by comparing credit derivatives to insurance. I studied and deepened my knowledge to obtain a certificate of asset management, and as an intern in the risk management department, I monitored risks related to the company's assets and applied what I learned to practice to develop the qualifications of financial experts. As I have also developed analytical capabilities with statistical projects, I can understand the process and results of data-based corporate credit ratings or asset management, and analyze customer tendencies based on past data to implement more effective asset management. In addition, I have worked part-time jobs for many years to satisfy the needs of customers of various nationalities, and I have also developed quickness and customer-oriented spirit. ??? 2-3 Please describe in detail what kind of dream you want to pursue in the field you applied for and why you want to achieve that dream at Shinhan Bank. ""From increasing the efficiency of WM to popularization"" ""I want to become an expert in the most efficient asset management by analyzing the characteristics of customers through more detailed clustering by demonstrating financial knowledge and statistical capabilities. I felt the importance of grouping through customer data analysis experience, and I will lead the WM market by establishing a more sophisticated system, going beyond the existing WM method, which is subdivided into three stages of Shinhan Bank. For asset management, I will realize Shinhan's 'knowing customers right away' spirit, which values accurately identifying needs by analyzing customers from various fields first. Another reason why Shinhan wants to achieve its dream is that it can utilize the integrated data of all affiliates in various ways with the 'One Shinhan' strategy. After developing expertise, we will study to supplement it by presenting variables that reflect reality more precisely in the robo-advisor algorithm. I want to contribute to the popularization of asset management services by developing AI as a means of assisting manpower, increasing its usability and accessibility."","""" Securing older customers of FinTech"" The financial industry is constantly changing with the development of FinTech. Just as Shinhan Bank introduced the data-based corporate evaluation process using the CSS model, it can be approached not only in terms of work, but also in a more convenient service for customers. However, this change did not reach the older people, as the mobile banking utilization rate over 60s was only 5.5%. The spread of digital banking among the elderly is an opportunity to not only achieve the social purpose of resolving financial alienation, but also to accumulate data in banks and establish a platform to deposit customers in various fields such as the retirement market.Shinhan Bank has also been operating a separate window for senior citizens since 2016, and has been targeting senior citizens through SOL Senior, etc., but since there are fundamental barriers to entry such as distrust of machines, a more multidimensional and active target is needed. We conducted an analysis on the use of apps based on panel data, and fintech apps used the most among households of 4-5 years old or older. They interpreted that there is a higher probability of using them with the help of children or grandchildren than with voluntary use. One way is to provide family-level benefits so that families can encourage them to use them. We also need to devise various creative solutions, such as providing benefits that are more realistic as a refund rather than a discount, taking advantage of the characteristics of the elderly who are sensitive to even a small amount of money. ""Achieving 250,000 views through collaboration."" Last semester, I made a dance video to promote the club with four members as the vice chairman of a performance club. However, the process was not smooth. The roles were divided by drawing lots of people who wanted to take charge of overlapping parts, but the team members who could not take the desired part showed their motivation as they did not attend the practice. I held an idea meeting to re-engage my team members' voluntary participation. It was to remind them of a common goal while setting up specific strategies for topicality. We shared various ideas at the meeting. One friend suggested recruiting a separate filming team from the school community, and the other suggested filming on the rival university campus considering that the university competition was a hot topic at the time. I analyzed famous dance video channels, and I saw the comment window activated when the same person appeared steadily, and based on this, I came up with the idea of taking several videos and uploading them consecutively. As I shared my opinions, I felt close to my goal. In addition, there was an atmosphere in which we recognized the credit of each other's opinions, so we were able to redistribute our dance by yielding our part. The team members regained their motivation and invited a filming team to film the video. After that, as a result of posting promotions on the community and dance-related sites through division, the video reached 250,000 views in one month. It was an achievement through teamwork,,,,"
"I feel proud of the process of seeing the meaning of the analysis results based on ideas, not simply processing and inserting data into a set analysis frame. It is not an exaggeration to say that the whole nation uses telecommunication services, and it will continue to expand in the future. I would like to feel the joy of collaborating with colleagues who are experts in different fields to produce meaningful results using the vast amount of customer data that LG U+ has accumulated over the years. In order to develop my expertise as a data analyst, I conducted projects myself by learning various ways to access data and interpret the results by looking at examples of analysis in my major class. One of them was a project that I carried out last semester when I participated in a panel big data analysis competition held by our school. The analysis was conducted under the theme of consumption patterns of grooming people (men interested in beauty) using app usage and card payment data of 115,854 respondents. In order to create a variable that quantifies the degree of interest in beauty, we have devised a new method that weights the item as the reciprocal of the usage rate among the total respondents of each cosmetic item, so that the more rarely used cosmetics are of greater importance. Through the R tree model, logistic regression, and correlation analysis, I was able to get cosmetics marketing insights for male targets, and I received the Excellence Award. In addition, I gained experience by making OOO prediction models and receiving feedback from professors. I learned coding with interest and enthusiasm as I worked in my major class learning R and SAS. In statistical analysis, I learned other programs based on my R skills and applied coding when I was engaged in other activities as well. When I was working as the vice chairman of a financial association, I added sessions such as finding bond prices in Python and replaying simulations to teach other students. When I was an intern at an insurance company, I saw that I used Excel for most of my work, and I learned VBA by myself to automate repetitive work, thereby improving my coding skills steadily."" In the second year of elementary school, I moved to the U.S. without being able to speak English at all and entered a local school. It was a difficult situation to face discrimination, but I was able to learn English in a short period of time by talking to my friends who were marginalized by short English. The childhood experience of making English my strength by taking advantage of the urgency of a situation that could have left me as a trauma gave me the confidence to challenge myself. I often hear from my friends that I am versatile. However, in fact, I think it's not because I'm good at it, but rather because I have a tendency to challenge myself with the mind of 'Shouldn't I be persistent?' Even though I had never learned Photoshop when I was working at a financial engineering association, I was in charge of producing promotional posters and watched YouTube lectures and made posters through Photoshop overnight. ""I booked a plane right away because I wanted to learn Chinese and studied there for a month. Like this, I will not be afraid of challenges for innovation and ability improvement at work,"" said Lee, ""I analyzed the propensity and consumption patterns of OOO (male interested in OOO) by using panel data of 115,854 respondents, the 2019 OO Big Data Analysis Competition, Excellence Award, Excellence Award. We measured the degree of interest in OO with a different approach and categorized the respondents accordingly, and conducted logistic regression, tree model, and correlation analysis to discover the patterns of consumption of the respondents, and organized them to gain marketing insights. [Intern], OOO Life Insurance's OOO management department, 20180917-20190228, daily stock and bond market conditions, calculated various risks related to the company's asset management, and prepared a report that integrates them.

"""I will create synergy between knowledge and passion."" I majored in industrial management engineering, but I am a late programmer who finally found my aptitude for IT after finishing the semester. For me, I think that LG CNS' smart factory/smart logistics job is a golden opportunity to demonstrate the knowledge I learned in the department and my passion for IT. I majored in industrial management engineering to learn how to manage various variables generated in the process through classes such as production control and management science, and I have experience working on the 'analysis and proposal of the current process' project through internships in the manufacturing industry. LG CNS is an attractive company to me in that it verifies applicants through internships with SW Boot Camp during the recruitment process. It is because I can experience the job in advance, and I can also develop in the process. I want to join LG CNS proudly by proving the synergy of my knowledge of process and logistics and passion for IT. I have two competencies to perform the smart factory/smart logistics job. The first is the IT knowledge necessary to design and manage the smart factory. I have been trying to understand the system logic based on SW algorithm by learning the programming language. After obtaining the information processor certificate and completing the six-month SW developer training course, I was able to learn programming languages such as Java and Oracle DB, and learn the latest IT trends such as new technologies and new security threats. Also, this year, I am working as a full-time researcher at the school to improve my data analysis ability. We are assisting in the 'Defect Analysis according to Elevator Vibration Pattern' project, and are acquiring Python, an analysis tool, and preparing for the sqld certification. Second, it is the ability to handle variables from the perspective of the supply chain, such as the perspective of facilities and the perspective of raw materials. I learned how to establish strategies for SCM and facility preservation through 'Management Science 1' and 'Management Engineering' subjects, and learned how to derive the optimal solution of productivity using 'Search for Solutions'. Based on this major knowledge, I worked as an intern at a manufacturing company in the second semester of 2016 and conducted the 'Analysis and Improvement Proposal of the Current Process' project. We analyzed the inventory management process by writing the relationship before and after the production process in the SCM flow chart, and calculated the defect rate through verification of the worker's work inefficiency. As a result of constant analysis and feedback, we were able to establish the data, and in the end, we announced that an additional cost of 27% was incurred due to the occurrence of duplicate and work inefficiency of the storage flow. I think the smart factory/smart logistics job needs parallel knowledge because improvement should be made in the IT system based on the understanding of the process. Through my passion for programming and knowledge and experience in process scheduling, I will become an essential employee in the manufacturing job."""" Specialist of MES solution development LG CNS provides various types of solutions depending on the IT area and the industry of suppliers. Among them, I want to become an employee who develops MES solutions that can coexist together by maximizing QCDs of manufacturing partners. To this end, I will work hard to understand the MES solutions of LG CNS such as iPhone CarmMES based on the process knowledge and programming ability. I think we can increase the efficiency of job performance by learning the logic and application method of solution. In addition, we will find suppliers, analyze how they are actually operated, and improve them to improve their job performance. After that, I will draw my future, which is called the 'key human resource of MES solution construction' at LG CNS. I will become an engineer who can provide competitiveness and flexibility to suppliers in line with the production ecosystem that will change radically."",,,,"
"When I decided to become a developer, my biggest goal was to see as many people as possible use the programs I contributed conveniently. There are many programs that pass people's hands, but financial services are always a service that exists firmly next to one person, and I wanted to become a digital financier and contribute to the development of the programs that each customer needs to shine on the company and myself. Also, as I have a hobby of trading stocks and cryptocurrencies, as I used many financial transaction programs, I wanted to devote my passion to these big financial programs. During development, the most important thing is 'Can users use all services conveniently while using the programs without difficulty?' The purpose of the program is to provide comfortable and accessible services to users, so we should try to make it comfortable and accessible. I think the behavior of developing and thinking about how to always put customers first, whether they can receive services more comfortably and whether they can receive trust, is the responsibility I should have as a financial developer. When I used IBK's homepage and application, I was amazed that all the values that were important to me were incorporated. User-oriented functions and design arrangements greatly ignited my passion to work for IBK. Even within the job application page, I dreamed of becoming an IBK person because I thought there was a lot to learn about the existence of trivial but definitely convenient functions such as the number of characters on the right side of the page and a spelling calculator. I was interested in blockchain technology and cryptocurrency ""solving problems through quick response."" I created an automatic transaction bot using a homepage and a specific exchange API that informs the market price and information of cryptocurrency. There was a meeting where we shared information and talked while investing in cryptocurrency, and I shared that if anyone wanted to use the automatic transaction bot program that I created by myself, I would use it even though I was not good enough. In addition, I made the program by improving the program, receiving opinions such as inconvenience to users and functions that would be good to be added. There is a clear difference between the functions that users think of as developers and the functions that users think of as convenient, and there is always room for improvement, so communication with users is important and we continued the development. While developing, there was a time when the program failed due to changes in the API. If it was a program that I use alone and develop, there was no problem, but it could have been a big problem because it was an important moment for other acquaintances to trade money. However, after learning that the problem had occurred, I quickly identified the problem and canceled the user's linked private API key to block automatic transactions within the program, and solved the problem by modifying the program. It was a situation that could have caused a big problem, but as a result of responding calmly without panicking, I was able to solve the error without any problems. This experience made me feel the importance of quick response with my whole body, and I also learned that I have to take great responsibility in developing as a program distributor. Breaking down barriers between developers and users, communicating comfortably, and improving programs are critical to the development of programs. I am confident that I will fully perform my role as software engineering to design and implement programs, improve errors and convenience through testing, and distribute them to users to advance programs.""""The innovation I have experienced is fingerprint recognition. When early smartphones were developed, there were two main methods of locking mobile phones: passwords and patterns. However, this was a lock that was far from strong security because it could be easily unlocked if someone other than the owner knew the password or pattern of the phone. When iris recognition was subsequently performed through the front camera, I felt that security was stronger than before, but there were cases where errors unlocked someone else's iris, and above all, it was so far removed from the most important convenience that people did not use it much even though the function existed. I also thought that all of the above-mentioned locking methods were cumbersome and cumbersome that the functionality was so inconvenient that I used a cell phone without using the lock function. But since then, fingerprint recognition has been a huge innovation for me. The method of fingerprinting security was unthinkable, the only security device that identifies itself, and it was very convenient as a system that recognizes with a short touch of a finger. Fingerprint recognition, which continues to be used as a mobile security device and is increasingly utilized, has become indispensable. In the past, when using mobile banking, simple identity authentication using fingerprints from uncomfortable functions that had to include all special symbols, English and numbers, has made financial services one of the convenient functions of life. Innovative functions are not limited to one area, but can be used in many other areas, and I think they should be efficient in terms of convenience and have a powerful effect in terms of security. Seeing that fingerprint recognition, which was one of the unlocking functions of the mobile phone, is now being used in finance as it is now one of the self-authentication functions, I think there is no shortage in being selected as the most innovative function of today."" As fast and easy services are pursued, faster and more convenient functions are emerging into the world. I-ONE Bank, which allows you to use financial services with only six-digit passwords instead of public certificates or complex passwords in a financial environment, is also a feature that highlights differentiation and simplification in a rapidly changing financial environment. However, behind the easy and convenient functionality, security issues are looking for opportunities to catch on. Financial customers want quick and easy features, but they are concerned about security issues and worry about using them.The occurrence of problems can happen anytime, anywhere, under any circumstance. I can't guarantee that all problems are blocked at the source, but I think a quick response is always possible. When a problem occurs, first, a quick apology to customers, then calmly identify the cause and solution of the problem, inform customers transparently, and respond quickly to the problem, which can be an opportunity to increase trust in customers. Quick response that turns a crisis into an opportunity can be an opportunity to win favor from customers and enhance the image of the company. In addition to coping with problems within the company, it is necessary to be able to present a quick response to problems caused by customers' mistakes. Everything is possible with mobile phones, but on the other hand, it has become a world where nothing can be done without mobile phones. The first thing to worry about when you lose your phone is the problem of financial services. Although it is the occurrence of a problem due to the customer's own mistake, a quick response that blocks the source of the concern one step ahead of the company will greatly help the company's growth. At the center of the direction listed above is the customer. We need customer-centered thinking that always puts customers first. If you think from the customer's point of view and always keep in mind what features will make you more comfortable, the company's authenticity will open its heart and become a company that can reach people more comfortably."",,,,"
"""Theory is weak but practice is strong"" In the computer structure lecture, I ranked 32nd out of 40 students in the midterm theory test. It was the result of not studying much because my theory was weak and overlapped with other tests. I usually listened to the lecture hard, but my midterm score was low, so I felt denied for listening to the lecture hard. I thought that the way to prove that I listened to the lecture hard was a practice project, so I set my goal of winning first place in the project. There were a total of 8 teams, so I thought it would not be easy to win first place. The project was to design an electronic calculator using Logic works. Basically, it was a project that was given an electronic calculator capable of only four four-digit arithmetic operations and added with the function in mind. Through meetings with team members, since the logic circuit consists of binary digits, we implemented the octogenarian converter, exponential functions, factoring, permutation, and combination operations. The aforementioned functions were implemented in the same way by other team members, which faced an obstacle of implementing new functions. In order to achieve the target of winning first place, a differentiated function was unconditionally required. Looking at the calculator to implement differentiated functions, I looked through Google how the calculations were performed and found that sin, cos could be implemented. Both sin and cos were implemented by simply calculating the front part using Taylor series to express the approximation. I added sin, cos, and finally, changed the calculation to 5 digits to complete the project. As I was working on the project, I thought I could win first place because I had invested 3 hours a day constantly in the project and created more functions than other teams. As a result of the project presentation and demonstration, our team was the only one who implemented trigonometric functions, and we achieved the result that we implemented the most functions and won first place in the project. From this experience, I learned that if you work hard, you will always get a result. SK C&C will also continue to work hard to prove the results of your work as achievements and contribute to the development of SK C&C through achievements."" ""Reduced number of return cases through meetings"" Working as a OOOOO tester, I served as the contact app domain leader. The common task was to solve OOO-related problems that came in every day, and as a leader, I assigned the task to the team members, synthesized it again, and reported it to the manager. In the process of solving the problem, the individual handled the problem, but even if the problem was corrected, it could not be solved and it was returned. Reprocessing the problem that has been returned resulted in a waste of time because the problem was handled twice, which could be solved at once. In order to prevent waste of time, we suggested to team members that difficult problems be resolved through meetings as a solution to reduce the number of return cases. The reason I haven't used the meeting in the meantime is that I'm concerned that even if a meeting is held, rejection may occur and it can be a waste of time because we spend time solving one problem together. However, I thought it would be wrong to judge the result before trying, so I tried for now. The introduction of the meeting had the effect of reducing the number of return cases, which was the previous goal. Time also resulted in an increase in the total workload of the problem, rather than falling at all, even if the time of the meeting was used, as the time to reprocess the return cases decreased. The manager suggested the same problem-solving method to other domains because of the successful result of reducing companion cases and increasing time efficiency. Conference was introduced in all domains afterwards as a result. SK C&C will also think of a more efficient way to solve the task in the process of solving the task through the experience of having successful results by incorporating new things, and will make an effort to increase the work efficiency by suggesting it to the team members.""""Still strengthening Programming Capabilities"" It is the basic and core of Solution SW's job. Because it is necessary to understand and process one's work. I made the following efforts to improve my programming capabilities. First, I took lectures focusing on programming. In the case of mandatory majors according to the completion system of the information and communication engineering department, the proportion of telecommunication and network lectures is higher than that of programming lectures. As a result, I thought that the required programming lectures were not enough, so I took the elective major mainly on programming lectures. By taking lectures on object-oriented language, practice, data structure, computer algorithm, and practice, I learned languages such as C++ and JAVA, learned algorithms and data structure, and built up programming skills. Second, I studied algorithms. I thought I needed to study algorithms because I thought algorithms were the core of programming. I studied algorithm theory first and then learned the basics by doing basic implementation. After that, I solved algorithm problems through online algorithm problem solving sites, reviewed my motives, and each code, and developed application skills. In addition to solving problems, I also studied algorithmic capabilities by completing 40 hours of special lectures on algorithms at Samsung SDS. Third, I worked on several projects. When I worked on projects such as ""Healthcare Application using Smart Watch"" and ""Smart Door Lock using BLE Beacons,"" I realized the right functions of each project. The projects received A+ and B+ grades, respectively. Through the results of the project, I was able to confirm my capabilities and realized that I should work harder. I think there is no end to the study of the developer. I think the moment I am complacent at my level, I am eliminated. In order not to be eliminated, I will constantly strive to strengthen my capabilities. I will do my best to become a company that will not be stopped even after joining SK C&C, but will always continue to be a talented person who will not be eliminated. In conjunction with OOOOO Systems, we have undertaken a graduation project under the theme of ""Smart Door Lock Using BLE Beacons.""It was too much to do everything alone by using the application, Arduino, server, and DB in the project, so I found a team, and four people including myself formed a team so that they could take on one part each. It was a short project that lasted for two months after the team was set up, and through a meeting with a company mentor, I set my goal to complete the unlocking function of the door lock according to the security level first. I was in charge of the application. First, I used Beacon for the first time, looked it up on Google, and studied it by asking a motive who used it before. After studying, I started implementing the function. After implementing a simple login system, I implemented a function that measures the distance from the target function, beacon, determines user information, and sends an unlocking signal to Arduino. In the process of checking whether the function is working normally with the Arduino team member, if the distance was set short, the problem of reaching the door before the door opened occurred. We continuously tested it so that it could be properly opened in time for the user to reach the door, and found and set the optimal distance of 3m. We successfully achieved the previously targeted results by integrating the implementation parts into one and creating a prototype with a storage cabinet by implementing each of the team members responsibly. In the process of writing patent drafts for submission after the project, there was a disagreement over whether to write the subject as a smart door lock or a small-scale bicycle smart lock. To select a topic, I consulted a mentor and was recommended a bicycle lock that was not registered in the existing patent, so I wrote the patent drafts as a bicycle lock. Based on the experience of collaborating with others on tasks that are difficult to do alone and trying to achieve common goals, SK C&C will also try to achieve the goal as an individual or a team member."",,,,"
"""Life with Games"" When I was in the lower grades of elementary school, I liked to play outside with my friends, and I was far from computer games or studying. Then, in the fourth grade, I came across Maple Story, which started its service in 2003. Easy and simple horizontal scrolling and cute graphics caught my attention, and I was able to experience characters from warriors, archers, wizards, bandits, and all occupations. Another game that was popular among classmates at the time was Crazy Arcade, where I played games for a long time, admiring the novel ideas of suppressing opponents with water balloons and the easy difficulty that anyone could play. Since then, I have expanded my feet by encountering Kart Rider and other games such as Trickster, Vegetable Club, and Grand Chase. In the sixth grade of elementary school, instead of running with friends on the playground after school, I even went to a PC room for the first time to play games together. I remember being amazed by playing games on computers with good specifications unlike at home. While entering middle school, I became interested in studying and always maintained a top grade. In the meantime, however, I enjoyed playing rhythm games such as O2Jam and DJ Max when I was not studying. I felt pleasure whenever I achieved a higher score than my opponent by choosing a song that was difficult to clear and competing with other players. When I entered a special purpose high school, I gave up all my hobbies because I was so into college entrance exams, and I focused only on studying in order to make choices that I would not regret in the future. After completing my long four-year entrance exam, after going to the university I wanted, I found the game again as a resting place when I was tired of difficult majors. In 2016, a game called Blizzard Overwatch was released, and when I went to a PC room with my friend's recommendation and played it together, I became interested in FPS after a long time since Sudden Attack I played in my childhood. Since then, I have enjoyed Nexon and Nadic Games' Closer for a while, and also played League of Legends, which had been the No. 1 PC room share for several years. In 2018, I returned to Maple Story, which ended the story of a black wizard with ""Teraboning."" During my five-year college life, whenever I was exhausted by midterm and final exams, I visited the PC room in front of the school to soothe myself. In retrospect, my life has always been with gaming."" ""My most passionate games for nearly two years were the online games ""Overwatch"" and ""Maple Story."" In 2016, as a junior, I had been depressed a lot after being hit with tough majors in engineering, and one of my best friends recommended me to play Overwatch. I was fascinated by the new genre of FPS, in which the team's strategic play is important, and I was fascinated by characters with a completely different style of play, although they have jobs like offense, defense, tanker, and healer. Overwatch was initially only a battle between players and competition for skill, but over time, it added different modes of play, and I think the most impressive piece of content that has been added is the melee that continues the overall story of Overwatch. I think the fact that there are no limits to the highest level of that game is another thing that sets me apart from other games. My level is now 414, and I have about 224 hours of play. Nexon's flagship MMORPG game, Maple Story, returned to action after watching the premiere of ""The Black,"" which released the final content of ""The Wizard"" in June 2018, which may seem like a short period of time, but the playing time is by far the best. Except for the exam period, I ran to the PC room and enjoyed Maple Story after finishing my studies. Back then, Maple Story released ""Terabening,"" a new content that improves the level by 3 to 200, and it didn't seem difficult to come back. Its highest level is now 275, and its highest level character has now achieved 211. Not long ago, Terabening returned for the vacation season, creating another professional character with level 200."" Among the games I have played in the last five years, online games include Maple Story 2, Elsod, Closer, League of Legends, Overwatch, and mobile games include Kakao Friends games, Kakao-Grand Chase, and Fate Grand Order. Among them, I will tell you about Cypherds and League of Legends. The two games have something in common called AOS, and the strategy of purchasing the right items, raising skill levels in real time, and taking down the opponent's team felt pretty difficult to me. The most interesting games were Overwatch, MapleStory, and MapleStory 2. For me, who didn't usually enjoy playing FPS that kills opponents with weapons in the first person's perspective, the importance of ""strategic team play"" such as taking up a foothold or pushing cargo seems to have come to me fresh. MapleStory, which was not an exaggeration to say that we grew up together since childhood, continued to introduce new content for about 15 years without stopping, and as a result, it had the charm of keeping the old feeling of longing. MapleStory 2 is the 3D version of MapleStory, so it was not difficult to adapt to the game because its essential content was similar, and I felt anew that I could customize my characters by creating my own 3D modeling. The least interesting game was the Closer. Obviously, the Closer's world view was fresh and the characters were attractive. The game itself wasn't boring, but a lot of bugs that couldn't be fixed and a leak of RAM halved the fun while playing. In addition, the consistent company's refusal to collect customer feedback seems to have made me increasingly tired and less interested as a user.""'Perfectionism for others' and 'playing games faster than anyone else' Since I was a child, I have been interested in games, and I have often looked for game-related tasks. Front-end development, back-end development, game planning, game art, game service, etc. There were numerous occupations at a glance. Among them, QA is especially the final process of making games, and hearing that careful work is required to reduce the inconvenience of game users due to bugs, I thought that it would be a good job for me, who felt uncomfortable if I didn't finish anything perfectly. Not only that, but it also felt attractive to be able to enjoy new contents of the game before other users. Entering college and entering my second year, I transferred to the Department of Convergence Engineering (now a software major) as a digital imaging major. Then, in my senior year, I took a major class called Network Game Programming. Understanding the concept of TCP/IP, building my own client and server to enable communication, and making games using it was the final task of the Network Game Programming course. Building the server wasn't easy for me, and I had to deal with a lot of bugs from the start. However, the process didn't feel painful. I would be absolutely delighted if I could make my own game perfect and someone else could enjoy it. With that mindset, I successfully created a small game that can compete one-on-one with users connected to the same server in real time after debugging countless times. And throughout my five years of college, I have consistently engaged in IT-related external activities. Throughout my career, I worked as OOO ICT mentoring supporters, Jotaek computer supporters, and supportive supporters of the game industry, I developed knowledge of the game industry and computer utilization skills, and communicated with my colleagues with respect for each activity. I think that my experience and my accumulated major knowledge will be helpful in communicating with developers to fix big and small bugs in the game. ""QA to challenge, QA to communicate."" If I join Nexon Networks and become a game QA, I will go beyond simply fixing the bug and suggest ways to improve the game. When I play the game from my user's point of view, I suddenly think, ""If this place is improved like this, users will be able to play the game more comfortably!"" Rather than arbitrarily deciding on these opinions, I will communicate with other users through SNS and lead the game improvement in the best direction. So my goal is to create a ""God Game"" that satisfies both the game producer and the user who plays the game. ""As always, as the first time."" Even three years after I join the company, I want to be recognized as the same person as the first time. I don't want to become a QA that handles things roughly as the trick increases even if I get used to my work. I will always keep my original intentions and keep poring over the game to see if there is anything wrong and if there is anything to improve. For the user, the same game will be a QA that plays dozens and hundreds of times with joy."",,,,"
"""Competition"" He was an ordinary kid with nothing special about him from an early age. As a result, I had a high sense of competition with my friends. I felt greedy that if someone did something, I could do just as much. The first step is to compete against a one-year-old Tuol's cousin when she turned 10. When I listened to the sound of a prodigy while memorizing a Chinese script, I thought I could do it, so I started learning Chinese characters. After learning for the next four years, I felt a sense of accomplishment through the Chinese character test, and as a result, I got excellent grades in Chinese literature when I was in middle and high school. During my school years, I competed with a friend who memorizes world geography, and started memorizing world maps, and I appeared in the Golden Bell as a specialty. Another time, when my friend's writing skills improved greatly, I started reading and essay writing and won an essay contest for the first time in my life. In the past and now, I am an ordinary person. However, I have a strong aspiration to improve myself. I will continue to digest the strengths of those around me as my own and develop myself."" For stable system operation, I took Internet security. I constructed and redistributed network construction using routers, dynamic static routing tables, and built firewalls using Linux. In the security network, packets were analyzed in real time, and defense activities such as firewall setting and policy setting were performed. After graduation, I completed an information security curriculum for eight months, understanding security threats from systems, networks, and applications, and learning how to operate security equipment. I think my strength is that I have used various server OSs in college and vocational education. When I was an undergraduate, I mainly used Ubuntu and Fedora, and I dealt with Sentos, Cali, and Windows servers in vocational education. In addition, I have experience of checking vulnerabilities of servers using Bashshell. After joining the company, I will master work quickly with a high understanding of the server. On the other hand, I failed to take the security management law course in the security engineer's writing this year due to my weakness in information protection laws and policies. With this opportunity, I had time to complete the personal information protection education and work together on the personal information protection law and security authentication system."" ""I first got to know Kali Linux while receiving information security education. Since it was developed for simulated hacking, various hacking tools were built-in, but it took considerable time and effort to learn 13 categories and more than 200 tools. So, I gathered friends and organized a hacking tool study. We decided to divide the groups of five evenly and present only two or three tools that we think are important. With the experience of learning in advance, it was easy to follow this class, and it was a good experience to increase the sense of responsibility for the task through efficient division of labor. In addition, by sharing the organized materials with the students in the same class, everyone could easily finish the mock hacking chapter.""""When I was a freshman, I had a major class where I presented as a group with a second-year senior every month. Due to my passive personality, I couldn't say a word properly at the first presentation. I prepared a lot, but I was so embarrassed because I didn't show anything. So I tried step by step to improve my presentation skills. In the next presentation, I made a script and presented it, and then I presented it with only keywords written. So, in the last presentation, I was able to talk to everyone in the eye. As a newbie, it is impossible to turn over a difficult task in an instant."" However, there will be no impossible if you divide difficult tasks into small pieces and realize them with a small but certain degree."" ""Responsibility."" ""When I was in charge of promoting a project on the theme of corporate security, I collected opinions from the team members and divided the roles. In the beginning, all the members of the group devoted themselves to their duties, but as time passed, they remained silent. In the end, the completeness of the mid-term inspection was lower than that of other groups, and I couldn't even answer the professor's questions. After the presentation, we shared our opinions on the deficiencies. All of the members of the group said that they lacked the information they needed and were less interested in. So, I applied for a corporate tour of a venture company and an IT security company. However, I was rejected because it was an important factor in the life and death of the company. However, I was not discouraged by the failure and started to look for other ways. Just in time, I heard that the World IT Show was holding a special industrial security exhibition. I was able to meet my questions and have a hands-on access to security products and new technologies while conducting hands-on interviews with my team members. I completed the project by building a sense of intimacy and increasing my participation in the project within a short period of time. After joining the company, I will use this experience to become a talented person who is responsible for my role. I always plan and proceed with anything with the principle of ""flexibility"" important. So, I often hear that I am ignorant among my friends. There are times when things go smoothly due to thorough preparation and planning, but there are times when things go awry due to unexpected tasks. Therefore, I will increase my flexibility by listening to others. Whenever there is a disruption in performing my duties, I will take all the opinions of the members and come up with a variety of best practices. I will become a talented person who can handle any crisis skillfully and perform successfully."" Starting from the ""Growing Company"" consultative meeting, KINX has now grown into a global Internet infrastructure company by partnering with European Internet operators beyond China and Japan. However, rather than focusing on IX services, I have come to support the company by seeing its growth and growth in new attempts such as CDN, IDC, and Cloud. In addition, practical welfare programs that support books, telecommunications, and self-development, and in-house events that promote unity among employees will greatly help the company grow by enhancing the company's compassion.""""I think it is more important to put the assets and information of our customers first than to provide convenient services. I would like to manage and operate the network and system infrastructure at IDC Center and encounter various errors and server attacks. Based on my experience as a system engineer, I will strive to establish a security system. To this end, I will do systematic and continuous information protection activities.We will analyze past hacking cases to establish defense policies, subscribe to major security reports such as Cisco, Symantec, and KISA regularly, and learn new technologies and security information. We will acquire CISSP and CISA within 5 years to gain international-level security technology capabilities and contribute to PIMS and cloud certification marks. Thus, we will become KINX's leading security expert.""""Talent for Change"" In the summer of 2017, I worked part-time at OOOO to supply materials to production lines. Although it was a well-known conglomerate in the industry, material management was not systematic. There were many cases where there was no stock left or it was in the wrong location on the computer, which led to conflict with the production line. I planned and proposed a new inventory management system called ""Pre-action and Post-reporting"" and received a positive evaluation from the team leader. Anyone could have done it, but I don't think he did it because it was outside his boundaries. I will become a talented person who does not fall into mannerisms even in the midst of repetitive work and pursues an innovative future.""???,,,"
"""Habit of making a solid plan"" I always set core goals and make long-term and unit plans before I go to work. This personality is one of the things I want to brag about the most, because I have achieved satisfactory results on my own. When I was a test taker, I always kept a daily life record and made a study plan every day, week, and month, and as a result of making up for my shortcomings, I gradually raised my score until the SAT and went to the university I wanted. During the enlistment, I found the necessary certificate and made a study plan, and as a result, I acquired certificates such as information processing technician and 1st grade computer activity along with an increase of 250 points on TOEIC. In addition, I was dispatched to the Eulji Training Center in the National Police Agency with the recommendation of the commanding agent who liked this aspect. Recently, I made a portfolio development plan a month ago, and as a result of actively using planning and management programs such as OneNote and Trello, I have completed the development of character tools. By further developing and utilizing these personalities, I will work meticulously to reduce problems that occur in the middle of development. There were times when I thought of an easy problem as complicated when I was coding ""efforts to improve algorithms,"" and I wanted to develop my ability to implement algorithms quickly and easily to overcome them. So I practiced at various algorithmic sites and studied the types and solutions. In addition, I participated in algorithmic competitions such as 'OOO Coding Festival' and 'UCPC' to compensate for my shortcomings, and I recently passed the OOO online test. I have a personality that likes to actively help and socialize with people who are ""friendly."" Through this, I also participated in job interviews with friends who were worried about getting a job, and the personality test that I conducted recently showed the highest score for social type and consideration for others. By demonstrating this personality, I will try to help the company proceed with projects smoothly without any problems. ""Collaboration experience through competitions."" In order to gain collaboration skills, I participated in contests with friends from various fields and won prizes, and I also learned personal lessons. At that time, I was the head of the development team and developed core technologies, serving as a link with other fields. When there was a problem between fields in implementing the server, I gathered my team members in person to hold a meeting and found an efficient way to implement the KakaoTalk API. There was a burden of learning new technologies, but I realized it with a sense of responsibility that it must be developed, resulting in increased accessibility. Through this, I learned the lessons of 'soft communication skills' and 'if you have a sense of responsibility, the rewards will definitely follow' along with external achievements. In addition, I will contribute to 'completed development' at the company based on the above experience. Lastly, I developed basic physical strength as a developer by studying and exercising English in my spare time. When I studied programming, I often referred to materials in English, and since then, I have been continuously studying English on a site called 'OOOOOOOO'. In addition, I have been increasing my endurance by exercising PT in my spare time to overcome the difficulties that arise during development with my mental strength. As a result, English literature can now be accessed without difficulty, and exercise can now be performed twice as much as before. If I join Gamevil, I will do my best to contribute to the company by steadily developing the necessary competencies in addition to the above. ""Technology of a company that entered the global market"" The reason I applied for Gamevil is that I am interested in the company's ""global technology."" Since childhood, I played many games and dreamed of becoming a game developer. So I launched my developed games on the market, won a prize in a competition I participated in to gain collaboration skills, and gained competence by studying at a game development institute. With these efforts, my current goal has become ""developing world-class games."" In this regard, I wanted to join Gamevil, a ""global mobile game company."" Gamevil is currently the only Korean game company with both business and development capabilities. With various publishing experiences, I went overseas one step ahead of other companies to conduct marketing and operations at home and abroad. In addition, he strengthened his HIVE platform and development technology by acquiring Com2uS, a rival company. He applied to become the head of Gamevil, which produces great results every year in the global market beyond Korea, and he wanted to learn technology, know-how, and a wide range of perspectives, and I want to develop a 'Global Game with 100 million downloads' in your company. ""Global Game Development Team Leader."" My goal is to become the 'Global Game Development Team Leader' that fits the company's talent and ultimately encompasses Gamevil's home and abroad. To this end, I will faithfully perform my duties at the beginning of my employment to earn the trust of my team members, and use my time outside of work to improve my English and algorithmic skills. Within five years after joining the company, I would like to participate as a developer of games that are being recognized as an 'active and growing developer' and, if I have the opportunity, I will participate in domestic and international development seminars to expand my knowledge and build my own development skills. After gaining such experience, I would like to become the 'Worldwide Game Development Team Leader' at Gamevil within 10 years. I would like to pass on my experiences to my colleagues and read them as well as lead them to grow together. Through this, I aim to develop a game that provides stable service overseas and I would like to challenge myself to present my team's technical skills at overseas conferences. I will try to help the company develop by achieving my goals step by step.""""Com2us Professional Baseball Series."" There are three main reasons why I like to play the Com2us Professional Baseball Series. 1.Real-time updates reflect players' actual performance since I was a child, so I naturally downloaded and played baseball games from the days of feature phones. I have played countless baseball games, ranging from in-person games such as ""Magumagu"" and ""Isamanru"" to management games such as ""Professional Baseball Manager"" and ""Professional Baseball H2."" However, this was the first time that the game was updated every week to reflect actual performance, and I felt the biggest fun in this regard. The game was operated in line with the slogan of aiming for the most realistic baseball game, so I was able to play it more interestingly. 2. As a person who aims to develop various patterns and commentary, I was most fascinated by it. Individual players have different sounds from the stands, and I felt the variety of ways in which players handle pitches. Also, I was able to play richly with both my eyes and ears, with the most commentary I have ever played. The number of test cases that I didn't usually think about when coding algorithms increased, but I am more impressed as a developer because I think I have realized unimaginable number of complicated cases with excellent algorithms in Com2uS pro baseball. 3. Real-life graphics, player, and stadium model When I also played NCsoft's H2 game, I felt the distinctiveness of Com2S pro baseball. First of all, the pace modeling of players in Com2S pro baseball became more detailed than in Com2S pro baseball. In addition, I think Com2S pro baseball has been meticulously implemented in that there are close-ups of players in key scenes. Lastly, in Com2S pro baseball, the detailed design of the stadium and the characteristics of the stadium made the players more immersed in the play. So, I was able to immerse myself more in Com2S pro baseball because of these points."""" Outstanding Portfolio of OOOO"" In the recent program, I was selected as an Outstanding Portfolio in Programming. The contents of the portfolio are as follows. 1. 3D Game Character Tool Period: 2018.08.10 ~ 2018.09.15 Personnel: One Development Language: C++, DirectX 11 Description: You can fight a demo and edit, save, and import the character members transform/model/collider/animation/action tree. Its core purpose is to implement Unity's UI structure, component method, and Unreal's behavior tree technology directly. 2. 3D Map Editor Period: 2018.05.06 ~ 2018.05.07 Personnel: One Development Language: C++, DirectX 11 Description: A program that edits the terrain and installs, saves, and imports Billboard and models. It is designed to obtain the technology of 'command pattern' among the design patterns and utilization of Fbxsdk, an external library. 3. 3D Tetris Period: 2018.03.17 ~ 2018.03.19 Personnel: One Development Language: C++, DirectX 9 Description: It is a game made by transforming the general 2D Tetris into 3D. It has improved the technology to implement puzzle algorithms and basic knowledge about 3D mathematics. 4. Metal Slug 3 Period: July 30, 2017-10.10 Personnel: One Person Development Language: C++, DirectX 9 Description: I copied Metal Slug 3. I studied basic design patterns and physical equations and applied them to my projects. ""Development skills gained through personal development and completion of the game academy."" First, I learned the game development process through the experience of developing puzzle games using JAVA and releasing them in the Google market while I was in university. In addition, I studied at the academy for a year to develop more systematic game development skills. While completing the academy, I made sure to complete the assignments and portfolios within the deadline, which raised the confidence in development and problem-solving skills. In addition, I also received a perfect attendance award for my sincere work in the process. In addition, while using DirectX 11 or developing games based on commercial engines, I gained experience in producing various 2D and 3D game contents. In particular, I had a great interest in design patterns and established designs through the experience of easily solving complex branches using ""state patterns."" So I tried to read design-related books such as ""Coding Technology"" and ""Refactoring"" and study open sources and apply them to projects. As a result, I have the ability to abstract common parts by drawing diagrams before coding and the ability to utilize various design patterns. I think these technologies will contribute to building a solid structure for the game.""???,,,"
"A challenge is to take risks, set goals, self-improve and take initiative in order to achieve them. I have built my own career by 'challenging' a new field for my dream. When I was in my second year of college, I was very interested in big data analysis that looked into the future by reading a book called Signal and Noise. I thought that the core basis of big data analysis was to build a platform for storing and processing vast amounts of data, so I dreamed of becoming a big data developer. To this end, I took the risk of starting a new field called IT and challenged the Java & Big Data Developer Training Course. First, I set my goal to be proficient in Java. Although I had difficulties with APIs and algorithms I encountered for the first time, I implemented programs such as mine search and multi-chatting after trying to know for sure through code refactoring. Furthermore, by completing the 'Academy Management Program' and the 'Social Baseball Organization Website' MVC2 project, I was able to acquire the ability to develop Java and various web development languages, Oracle DB, and spring framework. Through the successful completion of the course, I was able to learn the value of the challenge by acquiring my own know-how to acquire new fields as well as the basic skills of development. I will become a Hanwha person who constantly challenges and does not settle for the existing framework and develops day by day. Through the academy management project, I learned that 'collaboration' is to help each other's difficulties and move in a better direction. As I proceeded with the project, there was a difficulty in overall development progress due to the unbalanced division of work. The server I was in charge of had a high proportion of work because data transmission and reception had to be done with all clients. We publicized this problem situation and talked together, and found that the team members also had a burden of work. Based on related functions and logic, it was suggested to reorganize the division of work to cooperate more than before. With the help of the team members, I was able to build the server easily, and I also won first place in the process by analyzing the code created by the team members and demonstrating cooperation to help them complete their functions. Through teamwork by sharing not only each other's difficulties but also knowledge and experience, I was able to realize efficient work. Based on this, I will become a Hanwha person who can approach the difficulties of my colleagues first. In order to provide practical help, I will grasp the overall work process and secure expertise in the field I am in charge of. I once caused damage to my team members by giving up specialized training in Data Science. At that time, I did not have enough time to participate in the training while working on the MVC2 project, so I did not have enough time to fulfill my role. I studied R with the help of my team members to analyze the csv file I was in charge of, but I was eventually forced to quit the training due to the deadline for the project. I learned desperately that excessive motivation can cause great damage to the organization. Since then, I have made an effort not to reverse my failure by organizing schedules on a weekly basis, allocating priorities, and finishing important tasks in turn. Through this, I will become a member of Hanwha S&C who can completely perform my tasks and devote myself to the organization."" First, I am constantly interested in and execution of new technologies. After completing the Java & Big Data Developer Training Course, I was very interested in storing and processing big data and started studying Hadoop immediately. I learned MapReduce, Pig, Hive, and Hbase in a CentOS-based Linux environment, and I grew interested by analyzing vast amounts of data such as Seoul bus rides and U.S. aviation data. Based on my learned knowledge, I built a Hadoop cluster using AWS EC2 and am currently learning machine learning using regression analysis by working on a Spark MLib project based on EMR. Through this, I have developed my capability to build a data distributed processing platform related to Hanwha S&C's HONE-G platform. I want to grow into a big data developer who has secured expertise in distributed and parallel processing architecture by demonstrating my strengths. Second, I have math and statistical knowledge. If you lack understanding of data analysis terms and related formulas, you cannot provide the dataset that the analyst wants. While taking differential equations and applied mathematics, I dealt with complex formulas, learned numerical analysis, learned MATLAB, and improved my understanding of formulas used for data analysis. In addition, in order to gain knowledge of data analysis, I acquired data analysis quasi-professional certificates and learned data mining and R programming. Based on this knowledge, we will communicate smoothly with analysts and quickly provide the latest open-source technology needed."""""" I think SMART&CREATIVE is a creative thinking that looks at new problems and acquires the skills needed for improvement. This is essential to discover new IT technologies and apply them in the right place. In particular, the IT industry is making the transformation and innovation of IT convergence by utilizing creative thinking. Hanwha S&C has also used SMART&CREATIVE as its vision slogan to provide ""smart service that is always one step ahead of customer expectations."" I have experience in daily precipitation forecasting projects that successfully built a Hadoop cluster by introducing cloud. I came up with AWS that rents out capacity virtually, away from the traditional method of using VMware to secure insufficient capacity. After collecting and organizing academic materials, making my own manual to learn EC2, I was able to set up a security group and IP, and then connecting with putty to allocate sufficient capacity to build a cluster consisting of five nodes. It was a small project, but it was able to produce meaningful results. ""We were able to not only solve problems in a different way, but also learn the IaaS cloud and broaden our learning. We will not hesitate to learn new tools and languages for improvement, such as Hanwha S&C, which has the best cloud technology and significantly reduces the time cost of migration by introducing a 'jet converter' solution, breaking away from the traditional manual work.""???,,,"
"""Challenge: Courage to walk on the path of new ICT"" Among Hanwha's core values, I think I am a person close to ""challenge."" A challenge is the courage to walk on a path that no one has taken. I am from Seoul and Beijing, but I am currently working as a developer through various challenges. When I was a second year of undergraduate school, I translated for overseas exhibitions at an ICT company called OOO. At that time, I became interested in the field of ICT and started the challenge by taking a major in the IT department within the school. In order to make these challenges an opportunity, I prepared for all of my majors during the vacation, and gained confidence by getting close to perfect scores in most IT majors. After that, I left school and challenged myself. First, I worked for a year as an intern in the data department of OOOOOO, a clothing brand located in the U.S. As I was working on data management and research, I became interested in the data field, so I returned to Korea and looked for big data development work. Thanks to my hard work in programming during my undergraduate years, I joined the internship in the SW development department of OOOOOO, which is in charge of OOOO's digital solutions business, last October. It took a lot of challenges to start this unfamiliar path of ICT and to do development work. I have the courage to take on the challenge and the ability to bring those challenges to achievement. There were two projects that I remember the most about collaboration, ""True Meaning of Collaboration."" They were all in the same problem situation, but I was able to learn true collaboration with different responses. The first was the TCP/IP socket game programming project in the advanced programming class. This project was memorable as a case of failure. Despite being a programming class, it was a problem that all the team members didn't know how to code. The team members who couldn't code couldn't do anything because implementation was more important than strategy planning, and it was a tough situation because their teamwork score accounted for 30 percent in the project evaluation. In the end, I made all the projects by myself, and I couldn't produce the best results. The second is the HSI and RGB color model conversion project in the digital media class. For this project, we first had to understand the formula for converting HSI and RGB, and then we had to express it visually and finally we had three tasks to create code. This project also had a variety of team members, and most of them were not able to code. However, we tried to find what we were good at and collaborate as much as possible based on our previous experience of failure. A classmate who was good at math solved a formula and taught it, a classmate who was an art student expressed a color model in three dimensions, and finally, I worked on a program by solving the formula that I learned from my team member in three dimensions. I learned a lot from the fact that these students who are specialized in different fields can meet and produce results with a single goal. I was able to learn that collaboration is not just about dividing work and division of labor, but about working together in a single direction while taking charge of areas where we can do well with each other."","" [Understanding and Experience with Mobile Services] - For the job of developing and operating an application, it will first be necessary to understand the relationship between mobile services and users. Since my undergraduate years, I have been interested in UX and have taken related majors. In particular, I was able to increase my understanding of the user experience by experiencing a project to improve the service usage experience of Naver and KakaoTalk in the mobile service design class. Based on this, I participated in OOOO's Retail Shop Event App Project while working for OOOO. As an indoor location service app using beacon, I was in charge of managing beacon in this project and linking beacon to Android using OOOO's CMS. Through this, I was able to experience that large projects were systematically operated according to Agile methodology. I also learned that it is important to build and manage log data well for better service. [Practical English Competency] - I think English competency will be important as we have various overseas branches. I usually studied English steadily to develop my major, and as a result, I was able to get opportunities such as interpreting at overseas exhibitions and working at the headquarters in the United States. Through these experiences, I was able to develop my practical English skills. We can use this to communicate for better service operation and development.""""Creating a business that reflects users' future demand through technology"" First of all, I think that ""SMART"" is not just about sticking to the performance of technology in solutions, but about developing and operating that is more optimized for ""people."" In addition, I think ""CREATIVE"" is to predict users' future demand to create optimized services and implement services by obtaining new business insights through them. The current ICT industry is changing rapidly, and I think the trend of that change is ""people."" It is no longer a trend for people to learn skills, but to think and predict people, not technology. In this regard, I think Hanwha S&C's vision slogan is the best slogan to respond to the changing trends in the ICT industry. Since October last year, I have participated in a big data research project at Funta to present the business direction. In this project, I collected 9.5 million SNS data related to K-pop and developed code to find the meaning in the data by utilizing open sources such as NLP (Natural Language Processing) and machine learning. Through this experience, I learned that the big data field can contribute to the creation of new services that reflect trends, and I was able to develop my relevant capabilities. Based on this, I want to become a solution expert who reads the hearts of customers of Hanwha S&C.""???,,,"
"""Individual development is the development of a company."" I have seen a documentary about eBay Korea's Hackathon. Through this, I felt the development culture of eBay Korea and the passion of the members for development, and decided that I must join the company. I am a person who grows up on my own with pleasure always in mind. For example, I have built up my development capabilities by challenging internships and development clubs with the goal of becoming a Back-End developer. In addition, I worked on my own projects to solve the inconveniences around me. For example, I developed a department bulletin board notification system and a self-introduction letter management system. As such, I would like to take the initiative in learning and grow as a developer in five or 10 years. In this respect, eBay Korea decided to apply because it has a culture where developers can grow. I think Hackathon is a great culture where individual capabilities actively contribute to the growth of the company. This is because I can give pleasure and meaning to my employees and make them have a sense of ownership in that I contribute directly. Therefore, I think that my professional values to work, always thinking that it is my job, can be harmonized well on eBay. ""I will become an S/W developer who can contribute to eBay through leading growth."" ""Web Programming"" It is a subject that made me aim to become a back-end developer. It was interesting to interact with the database inside the web application, design the business logic, and write the code that provides direct service. I studied Servlet/JSP by myself, and furthermore, I was equipped with the ability to build API servers using Spring Boot. In addition, I was in charge of back-end development in development clubs and interns, and I often used Ajax and JavaScript. Based on this, I will contribute to eBay Korea's back-end development. ""Data Structure"" It was interesting to solve the structure of data and while implementing it. Furthermore, it was a subject that gave me an opportunity to come across what is called problem solving programming. While interacting with this subject, I learned algorithms such as full exploration, DP, and alignment. I attended the class by creating my own library through the process of getting to the core of the problem and generalizing it. Also, it was interesting to learn different ways of thinking by looking at other people's codes. Even after joining the company, I will continue to learn algorithms so that data structure and algorithm knowledge can be used for actual work.""""Department bulletin board""Department bulletin board is not RSS supported, so I could not receive notifications when a new article was posted. To solve this inconvenience, I carried out my own personal project. It periodically crawls the bulletin board based on Quartz scheduling, and performs data comparison based on the key of the MAP to search for a new article. If you find a new article, it consists of the process of sending FCM to users who want to be notified of it. This project is developing with me. When I first started this project, I used Socket. However, I learned JSP/Servlet, Spring Boot, and ORM through personal learning, internship, and development club activities, applied them to the project, and performed refactoring. Even after joining the company, I will not only use my knowledge or work, but also apply it to personal projects to improve my development skills. In addition, if there are any inconveniences in the way we work, we will become a developer who can solve them with software. ""Tag-based Image Search"" ""I have experience participating in OOO and developing a ""Clothes Search"" that can find clothes for specific shopping malls as images. I used Microsoft's Custom Vision Service API. The ""Clothes Search"" searches for images using the data learned based on tags. For example, if you upload a related image with TAG {One Piece, Check}, the image for the TAG has been learned. Here, when a user uploads a specific image, the system analyzes it and informs the similarity for each TAG in numbers, and outputs and shows images in the system with tags higher than 90%. If the above technology is used in eBay Korea, it will be able to lead E-Commerce in its clothing field. The first reason is the rise of user experience. Unstructured thoughts are difficult to search because they are difficult to express in keywords. If a user can search for clothes with images, it can be a service that can satisfy usability and usefulness. The second reason is to gain customers in the apparel sector. Unique and innovative services will be an opportunity for customers to use eBay Korea.""???,,,"
"My strength is that I am meticulous, meticulous, and I want to finish something perfectly when I do it. Sometimes, I like to follow the standard of practice enough to be told by my colleagues that I feel frustrated because I don't know the ropes well. Because of this personality, I am studying not only the previous questions by memorizing them, but also by reading the basic books, understanding the theories accurately, and moving on, and then by reviewing the contents through the previous questions, I think I was able to achieve good results in the academic exam or the certificate exam. My weakness is an obsession caused by pursuing perfection. I get more stress than others because I think I am in serious trouble if I don't meet the daily tasks or quotas because I set a goal of doing something until the end of the day and try to keep it. In order to overcome these shortcomings, I thought I would need to accumulate knowledge that could be helpful in performing tasks. That is why I am studying for an information security industry driver certificate to gain extensive and in-depth knowledge about security. I am also trying to think positively and try to be less stressed. Before that, if I was discouraged by the thought of 'Why can't I do it?' Now I think I will study more if I want to do this assignment. Even if it takes a while, I won't give up, so I will be able to do it.' I think the biggest achievement I made during my school year was in credit management. With my interest in security, I went to the Department of Security, but my first class was mainly focused on basic subjects such as English, mathematics, and science. After the first semester of the first year, I started taking programming classes related to my major for the first time in the second semester, and I performed the task of making a maze game until the end, showing my standard of penetration, and I got good grades. Since then, the fun of learning about the major has led me to follow the department class passionately, and my grades have been on the rise. As a result, the grades, which were only 3.5 in the first semester of the first year, were raised to 4.4 in the second semester of the second year, when the students began to take the security-intensive major. In the process, major classes were never present by proxy or absent, and I think it was important to try to communicate with my assistant or professor and solve problems that I did not know. I had a perception that the most important part was to build up my major knowledge that I thought was basic. So I was able to keep it for four years without giving up or neglecting it after working hard for a few semesters, and I can be proud that the constant effort is an outstanding achievement.""""I worked on a project to model the IP traceback technique in a class called Big Data Application Security. The project was divided into four areas: Python, Hadoop, R, and Arena, and I was responsible for analyzing the correlation between IP header fields using R. The team formation was done randomly, but compared to other teams, the atmosphere at the beginning of our team was not passionate and individualistic play was strong. During the team meeting, we did not proactively present ideas or report detailed progress on the role, and we did not get any answers when we asked questions or opinions on the group chat room. At first, I planned to follow the lead if anyone had a friend, but I was embarrassed by the passive atmosphere. After doing my part to encourage the active participation of the team members, I organized the ip traceback technique and informed the team members of the initial Arena sample model formed by another team member to tell them what was wrong. I also read the materials to be presented by other team members in advance and advised them on what to fix. As a result, the team members began to exchange opinions on the final outcome one by one, and shared their roles. As a result, I was able to get good grades in the team project and received compliments indirectly from other team members. At first, I was worried that the result of the project would be disgraceful compared to other teams, so I was able to lead the team and act as a mood maker for the first time in a project that I spent time on, and it was an experience where I felt proud through the changing atmosphere and progress of the team."" Since I was young, I have enjoyed playing RPG games, and my experiences of being hacked into my account at the time have led me to dream about becoming a security expert. After that, I went to a related department, and through my studies, I gained basic knowledge about it and security, and obtained the information processing industry engineer and information processing engineer certificates in order. After that, I participated in a two-month internship at a network security solution company to experience what I was doing at a real security company. I was interested in system security by participating in writing various vulnerability help, writing buffer overflow exploit reports, and writing articles on the latest security trends, and recently I prepared for an information security technician exam. As I was preparing for the exam, I became interested in monitoring the system through the security log and responding to violations, so I wanted to work for a general company rather than a security company. The decisive reason for applying for Webzen was that it was something I wanted to do normally after seeing an open recruitment announcement. In addition, if I work for a game company where young and passionate people gather in security, I think I will be able to come up with ideas to respond to new situations every day, and I will be able to breathe and enjoy myself in a free atmosphere."" ""I feel responsible for my duties and plans once, and I make sure to communicate clearly so that there is no misunderstanding in the communication process, and I try to make sure to know what I don't know for sure.During the winter vacation of the second semester of my second year, I slept less every day to achieve my goal and studied on my schedule, so I raised my TOEIC score by about 150 points in one month. When I started studying for a certificate, I was meticulous enough to read and read theoretical books two or three times to build up my foundation step by step, despite the reviews that I would pass if I solved the previous questions. Because of this personality, I don't like to go wrong or not finish my job, so I have taken on the job as much as I can and achieved good results. In addition, since I am not quick-witted in the communication process, I tend to ask questions and organize my thoughts and knowledge in order to understand the intention I want to convey at once. I participated in a firmware reverting study in my department's lab. At that time, it was a method of verbally conveying the progress of the study, but I wrote and presented what I had studied in the first hour in a good way that it looked good, and as a result, it was improved by generating presentation materials every week with good responses from study participants."",,,,"
"I became interested in security experts after I had several experiences of being hacked into game IDs and large portal sites that I enjoyed for neglecting account management in high school. After that, as I entered the security-related department, I was assigned to investigate security accidents, and I learned that there were many security accidents that started with the carelessness of the manager or neglected vulnerabilities. After that, I thought that applying the security theories obtained in the department class to real situations and checking for vulnerabilities fit well with my meticulous and principled personality, so I wanted to do something to manage the security system. KT recently had security accidents related to personal information leakage in 2012, 2014, and 2016, and I applied because I wanted to unfold my dreams and passion in the process of experiencing these accidents and growing into a stronger and safer company. Recently, I heard an article that concerns about security damage are circulating with the start of the Fourth Revolution. After joining the company, I want to aim to strengthen the security of products related to the iot service and AI industry. KT's latest artificial intelligence service called Giga Genie examines security issues that may arise from the introduction of speaker recognition technology, and in the long run, I would like to contribute to becoming a company with the image of 'Reliable KT' by applying a vulnerability check list that can be applied to other industrial products in the future. ""The challenge that I persevered with the most was to raise my language score. My first TOEIC score was about 560. The reason I studied TOEIC was to meet the lowest score to get a scholarship at school, and I had to score over 750 to be recognized until I graduated. I quit my private academy to start studying, but I applied without knowing it, and I ended up taking classes with students in the range of 700 points. At first, I couldn't attend the high-level classes and homework, so I couldn't even participate in the remaining studies and did homework at home. I couldn't meet my friends for the first month and slept for five to six hours a day because I had to do new homework every day and I had to do it on weekends. As a result of constantly making study plans and living according to the schedule, I was able to achieve much higher score than I wanted in two months because I was afraid that I would want to go off the mark for a day. Through this experience, I was able to break the stereotype that I have no connection with English, and I realized that no test can pass if I try hard. In addition, I don't think that getting a high score is just a story of others, but I have also become a habit of setting goals step by step and periodically checking progress to improve myself."" Last semester, I worked on a team project called Big Data Application Security to analyze big data attack logs and create simulations on how to detect ip spoofing. The project was conducted in a way that a group of four divided Python, R, Hadoop, and Arena into individual parts, and I was in charge of analyzing the correlation between the ip header fields extracted from a large number of logs using R. The goal was to acquire various tools through cooperation, but the initial team members did not pay attention to the other team members' parts, thinking, ""I need to do well in my part."" However, in the atmosphere of the group Kakaotalk Room where my friend in charge of Arena's part, who has not made progress for several weeks and no one is interested in it, I cycled the interim simulation made by the team member and gave feedback to activate the group Kakaotalk Room. Later, when the team member said to me, ""You seem to be the hardest working member among the team members,"" I felt proud, and the final presentation of our team was also well received. Through this experience, I learned that even if all the team members are passive, I can get a positive response by showing passion for even the smallest thing that I can help others."" ""The core competency I think is the ability to grasp the core when having work-related conversations with practitioners. First of all, in order to grasp the core, one must have basic knowledge as well as related terms as one's own. I was told by the professor who took the CISO position while taking the mobile swsecurity class last year, ""I am in the IT security department in actual work, but I can't talk because I don't know the basic terms."" And while working as an intern, I started studying for certificates on the advice of the head of the headquarters. I obtained the information processing technician license this year and am currently studying the information security technician license. It was good to be able to organize security terms that I learned for nearly four years while studying handwriting, and I am preparing for practical tests by running the security tools in the book and learning how to use each option. In addition, after two months of internship experience at a security company, I learned that I need to know rapidly changing security trends and new attack techniques to operate the system in response to them. I usually look at websites such as Security News, Daily Securities, and Anlab's latest security news to focus on the recent security accident news and new vulnerability analysis. This is helpful for obtaining certification in the short term, but in the long run, it is like having a meeting with team members or studying in advance what to do when operating other companies' security equipment in the event of a security accident, and I think it can be a small experience."""
"""My growth plate remains open."" I grew up thinking of 'growing' as the most important value of my life. What I'm referring to as 'growth' is the constant pursuit of new things. I've always loved solving math problems since I was young. But after solving a problem, even if the answer was correct, my method of solving and the method of solving the answer sheet were always different. It was interesting to me that one problem has many solutions. So it has become a habit to learn new solutions, make them my own, and think about whether there is another solution in various ways. I don't think this is limited to math problems. If you approach an issue in the same way, you can lose ways of thinking in various ways, which is an obstacle to your growth. So I don't settle down to the old way, but always pursue new things and make progress. And 'growth' is about listening to other people's voices at the same time as constantly pursuing new things. When there is a problem, no matter how many ways you think alone, there are limits and sometimes it is hard to get out of bigotry. I don't hesitate to accept and adopt other people's opinions. You may think that this blurs your subjectivity, but I don't think so at all. Rather, I think that through other people's thoughts, you can discover your shortcomings and improve them so that you can have a clearer subjectivity. I am also confident that this nourishes your growth, and furthermore, it will help your team grow. I think this tendency is also consistent with the vision that LINE pursues. ""I think LINE and I will be partners who can create the best synergy effect."" ""There is no game that you can't make with passion."" During this summer vacation, I created a mobile game while working in a joint development club called OOOOOO. Our team of three developers and two designers created a game called ""OOOOOOO Galaxy."" You can earn coins through three mini-games and purchase new fidget spinners with the coins. As a developer, I made one mini-game, and I participated in some of the store system and game balancing. The development tools used Unity2D and C# scripts. In this game, I used NGUI, Unity's representative and powerful UI system, and an asset called LeanTween, which can effectively animate. Implementing the game UI and animation has little to do with the game's core logic, but it takes a lot of time to implement it properly. However, I used the aforementioned assets to effectively reduce the time, and was able to focus more on implementing the core logic of the game. Meanwhile, one of the developers went out for personal reasons. And I took over the part that the person who left was developing. At first, I thought it would be easy to continue making it because it was already made to some extent, but it was a big mistake. The style of coding with me is completely different, and most of all, there was no annotation, so it was very difficult to understand the code. So, I tried to code in my own style from the beginning, but only refer to the existing code for parts that were difficult to implement. It was a long process. But I couldn't delay time because I had work that I'd done before, and I didn't mind staying up all night. As a result, I was able to catch up to what I had done before in two days. And in my mini-game, certain objects had to be created and destroyed more than 10 times per second. But in the process, there was a lot of throughput, which caused the game to stutter. So I solved it by creating objects only at the beginning of the scene, and reusing them all. There were many other difficulties, but I also referenced the Scripting API on the official Unity website and solved them through active communication among team members. As a result, I completed the game within a period of time and was selected as an excellent work by the club. It has now been uploaded to the Google Play Store. My experience like this will be very helpful for me to work at LINE."",""""Game Developer, who truly loves games."" My experience of passion and dedication was working on the game development team at OOO, a university game club. After I was discharged from the military, there was a period of skepticism and lethargy about my department. At a time when I wasn't sure what to do, I joined a game club just because I liked games. And there I met some game-loving classmates. I had a lot of fun. All the club activities were playing games together and talking about games, but I was amazed at how lively I was. So I thought, ""Let's do something by combining it with what I like, not just feel skeptical about academic work."" After that, people who were interested in game development gathered in the club and formed a game development team. It was the beginning of my game development career. The initial game development team of 7-8 people started by conducting game-related seminars every week. I prepared and participated in seminars on various topics related to development, further developing my passion for game development. That was only a year ago. Over time, the scale of the game development team grew, and last winter vacation, we divided into three teams and produced games for each team (see portfolio). However, our team was at a loss because everything was our first time. So we got together every day to discuss countermeasures, and I studied about the Unity engine. I learned much faster than I did before when I was learning my major at school. I knew that at this point.That programming is not about studying ""to become a programmer"" but ""because I have something to make."" And despite having to do everything from learning necessary knowledge to producing for two months, I was able to launch a game that I had planned. I think I can do anything with my love and passion for these games. Although I'm not sure I'm better than any other developer when it comes to development expertise. But I have more pure passion than anyone else. It started with my passion and need, and in a short period of time, I created something from nothing. I'm all set to play a role as a game developer at LINE,,,"
"""We Make a Trend"" The start-up club ""TrenData,"" which was founded to create a new trend with a convergent mind, conducted weekly trend seminars and found start-up ideas. The weekly trend was an activity to research, present, and discuss trends in ICT technology and market issues and changes. In addition, based on the trend presented by students from various departments, we tried to analyze market problems and present a new paradigm to the market with a start-up mind. Through trend presentation and idea discovery activities conducted for more than a year, I was able to quickly learn the changing trend of the ICT market. In addition, all club members presented and created new ideas together, rather than devising ideas with their own thoughts through discussion and ID discovery activities based on the published data. Based on these club activities, it was an opportunity to challenge the start-up of a business under the theme of Some: See O2O service by converging ICT technology and culture and arts with the award of four contests, and creating a new market by utilizing public data."""""" -Overview The public data analysis and visualization platform based on big data, also known as GView, which won the Excellence Award in July 2014, is a platform that enhances convenience so that not only experts but also the general public can find and visualize the value of data among countless public data. -Proposed Background In line with the opening of public data, which is the core strategy of the government 3.0, GView proposed to develop a big data analysis/visualization platform to create a platform that can analyze big data that was not easily accessible. In the existing market, when analysis data was needed, big data analysis companies and data scientists mainly analyzed the data needed. However, this idea was proposed to break the existing market framework and come up with a way to easily analyze data even for ordinary people who do not have expertise."" ""This idea focused on two keywords: analysis and visualization. The core elements of data analysis technology are Hadoop and Hadoop Echo systems that can handle large amounts of data. These technologies have grown and developed rapidly with the advent of big data. The technology of the big data industry is continuously growing as it is used by world-famous companies such as Google and FaceBook. At the same time as saying, ""The era of big data has arrived,"" many companies are doing many businesses using big data, and the economic profit generation is also increasing every year. The idea was to process a large amount of unstructured data that had not been processed so far by using Hadoop, which is the core of these big data analysis technologies. In addition, in the field of visualization, 'how to show the data' to the user was selected as an important keyword. To make it easier for customers to understand the analyzed data, the data visualization tools such as Weka, R, and SPSS were used to communicate information effectively using charts and various visualization means. Through this plan, we wanted to provide an opportunity for users to analyze the research activity index they want with simple data input and gain new insights within it.""???,,,"
"""Would you like to collaborate with KT and my passion?"" The motivation for applying for this job is in line with my interests. Currently, KT is starting a new trend by introducing the artificial intelligence TV GiGA Genie. I think this is a huge advantage. Most household appliances in Korea are TVs. Therefore, it is possible to use multiple IoT services efficiently by using AI TVs with high accessibility. In addition, after participating in the Seoul Motor Show in March, we linked GiGA Genie to the car and demonstrated vehicle control through AI-based voice recognition such as remote start-up and location guidance. As such, KT is changing our daily lives with rapid momentum through the AI field. I was also interested in AI field and gained experience and knowledge in it through my studies and projects. So I applied because I thought it was more suitable than anyone else for this job. And I thought that KT's best-skilled employees will be the support group for the development of professionals, so I thought I could realize my vision and grow together. After joining KT, I will first develop basic job competencies and become GIGA-level newcomers in the SW development profession. After joining the company, I will build up my expertise in deep learning by building solid basic knowledge for five years. I will develop the ability to quickly solve any problems by running around and studying or attending conferences by building deep knowledge. In 10 years, I will create various ideas and skills that KT's services can connect with people anywhere.""""Learn responsibility and cooperation""Team project leaders need to be responsible and cooperative. I learned that when I joined an academic club at a university. I gathered with my friends who had a lot of things to learn, studied, and helped them to know each other, thereby building knowledge. I went to a household appliance contest to broaden my horizons. I aimed to make laundry management APP with NFC function according to my team members and the theme. So, I made it possible for users to check the laundry guidelines with the Yahoo weather API. And accordingly, I could set the laundry timer. As I was working on the project, I planned the schedule as the leader and coordinated with the team members. However, in the previous experience, there was a short production period and a problem of having to create ideas and functions for the school project. So, we divided the roles based on the areas that the team members were good at and revised and supplemented the schedule to resolve any problems. As a result, the project received favorable reviews. So, I was able to intern for three months and learned a lot of experience. After that, I took the position of the head of the school in the club, and I was able to win the Best Team in SW activities as I continued to work with the project. Through this experience, I gained a sense of responsibility while being a leader, and I understood that teamwork toward goals is important in the project. With this sense of responsibility and the spirit of collaboration with the team members, I will make a service for everyone at KT."",""""Energy Hackathon: Learn Passion"" I went out to the hackathon and showed my passion without giving up even when I encountered time limits. Through the energy Hackathon, I was able to check the electricity usage at home in advance with a smartphone, so that I could create an energy-saving APP that could plan the use of electricity. However, since a lot of technology has already been developed, people around us gave negative opinions. So we thought differently and thought about whether it was convenient to use from a user perspective, even though it was already made. Young people usually use smart devices well, but my grandmother and grandfather thought of what they still have difficulty with and what the blind are uncomfortable with. So, for the elderly and the visually impaired who cannot use electronic devices well, we decided to add an ARS function to implement a function that can inform them of the gold used by voice according to the power they currently use. I made the Android part and let the team members use each API to make it. We divided the roles and proceeded according to the limited time. As a result, more than half of smartphone users in their 30s and 60s were evaluated to be able to easily understand how much they consumed in terms of money through the service, prevent indiscriminate power consumption, and prevent loss of money for individual families, and received the Energy Hackathon. So, I learned that the results of development after thinking about the customers' minds can be more efficient. In the future, I will join KT with a village for users and try to complete it without giving up despite many difficulties. In order to produce the ""Challenge Spirit and Machine Learning"" project, it is necessary to make efforts to find and study new technologies in person. Such thoughts are due to the experience I gained while conducting a contest with my friend in college. For the contest, I aimed to produce a program that made it easy to recognize, store, and modify the score. So, I wanted to give convenience to those who use guitar through the program. To this end, I worked hard on planning and production for 3 months with my friend, but I couldn't get a prize in the end. The reason is that the guitar codes in the sheet music in the image have a low recognition rate. This is because the sheet music image lacks recognition depending on the slope or shadow. Through this, I felt that machine learning was necessary, and I learned other codes by using open source tessellation ocr. After learning about each guitar code, the recognition rate definitely increased. Through these efforts, I tried to improve the project and challenged the contest again. As a result, I was awarded the best team in the OOSW contest and experienced firsthand whether many people were interested in machine learning along with the new knowledge of machine learning. With this opportunity, I studied AI on my own and held a seminar in front of more than 20 students on the subject I studied. It was a special experience to solve problems by studying and using new technologies that I only saw as news articles.Through this active thought and continuous skill acquisition, we will change the world with KT."",,,,"
"[Write it big] I chose Samsung Electronics to go to the place called 'Dream' because the first thing that people in many countries think of is 'Samsung' when they think of Korea. Many young overseas students still carry cell phones with Samsung logo on them. When I saw Samsung on the donation list of the British Museum during my trip to Europe, I felt that it was Samsung that made many activities and donations from all over the world. As such, I wanted to join Samsung and make many innovative products to publicize the country and entertain many people. Also, working for Samsung, a place with the world's best technology and value that contributes to Korea's many developments, is helpful for national development and overcoming the crisis. The name 'OO' means that I will use it big, not replace it. Just like the name, I will become a master of IoT in 10 years. Just as Samsung developed ARTIK for IoT, in 10 years, we will provide convenience and pleasure to all products as well as autonomous cars, smart watches, and smart homes can be connected to customers. I believe that the greatest reward of developers is to make customers happy with the results they have made. After joining the company, Samsung Electronics will make everyone in the world edgy...""[Living the same way as yesterday and expecting a different future is like getting sick] Einstein said. In other words, whatever you aim for, you should not lose your passion and work hard. My goal is to make products for everyone in the world. I had this goal when I joined Samsung Software Membership at the recommendation of my seniors in college. As my seniors recommended, I was able to gather with friends who had a lot to learn from, study hard, and help each other gain a broader perspective and knowledge. One of the most memorable things in my membership was the Samsung project conducted by the home appliance business department. To make washing machines in the home more efficiently, I want to create an app for NFC function and a prototype that efficiently provides users with a laundry guide and notification system for current weather. I felt a sense of responsibility for the work as I worked with the idea of making products for actual customers, from project proposals to prototype programs. Afterwards, I felt like I wanted to make products convenient for people, and I promised to study for a lot of my major knowledge. Samsung also aims to provide a 'better world' to its customers. I want to join Samsung, which has the same goal and dreams of the future as me, and grow into a programmer who will change the world. So, I have continued to develop my two strengths to provide products to customers with stable and high satisfaction. First, I have a lot of experience in IT-related activities. I participated in various internship programs and hackathon related to IT to achieve the grand prize by showing my creativity. In addition, I was awarded the certificate as an outstanding team for Samsung S/W activities by demonstrating my leadership as the head of an academic club, and gained an excellent IT knowledge in an academic competition on campus. Through this, I learned the importance of passion for my goals and was not afraid of failure. These experiences can create rapid organizational convergence and synergy after joining the company. Second, strong DB knowledge. Data base is an important technology that goes into every program. This is because we need to build a DB to have information even if it is a small program and use it again. I felt that this DB was important, so I studied and acquired the OCP certificate. And based on this, I created a POS system using Oracle. While studying in the DB lab, I studied how to develop it to become a safe program. While producing this program, I became more confident about DB production. This IT knowledge will help to increase the safety of production programs. With this potential, we are trying to become a talented person who can present our vision to the company in the future. We will continue to cultivate these strengths to become one that changes the world at Samsung."",""[Unmanned cars and deep learning] Currently, many companies around the world are interested in autonomous cars and are investing in development. Tesla CEO Elon Must said that he would complete the preparation for commercialization of autonomous cars in September 2018. And Google, Toyota, and Hyundai cars are also investing a lot in developing these technologies. Watching these news, I was curious and interested in how such technologies could be made, and while studying artificial intelligence myself, I learned how to solve problems with the power of collective intelligence with a lot of information. And in Hong Kong, it was found that by dividing the subway maintenance time into a timetable through deep learning, the work efficiency was increased by 30%. And Google or YouTube extracts feature points with each image and video and creates the information that the user wants again. And Facebook automatically finds and creates relational data that allows you to find facial features and create names or know your relationships with others when you upload a picture. I think this development of deep learning will lead to another IT innovation. Already, Korea has the world's best Internet and smartphone penetration rate, but the platform to lead the market has not been completed. If the platform is established, I believe that building the ecosystem of the Internet of Things will eliminate the limited types of products and their range of use. In addition, deep learning technology will be absolutely necessary to provide services to products. This is because the amount of information we can have will gradually increase in the future.Through this, I think it will be common to collect information with big data, process it with deep learning, and then help people through the Internet of Things (IoT). More broadly, I think businesses can be created and jobs can be created in many new fields."",,,,"
"""Change the world through music."" I think songs are a big part of people's lifestyle. I am constantly interested in music such as Superstar K, Produce 101, and The Masked Singer. Such interest is spreading Korea around the world through K-pop. Bugs provides the largest sound source in Korea through various platforms in high quality. Therefore, I think working at Bugs Music, the best of music services, is a development and rewarding job in Korea. I am trying to change the world with IT with the idea of SMART and CREATIVE to join Bugs. While working as an intern, I built a web service that records and manages personalized services as My To Do. Although there are many TODO services, many people currently create a lot of things to do through job studies, but we tried to solve the inconvenience of not sharing their schedules due to spatial constraints by creating a TODO list. And I started with the mindset of actually producing using everything I learned. I started production using Spring Boot, and DB used MySQL. And I applied Nested Results for Collection with the Mapper from MyBatis. And I used Jenkins for CI to make continuous management easier. And I wrote a cleaner code using coding conversion, and I made UnitTest test the code for the service sector. And I tried to make the service sector more secure by using transactions. Unlike students, in practice, a project is not one alone, but several people. So I think we need someone who has experience in CI and thinks about algorithms and safe codes. Even if I join Bugs in the future, I will be an applicant who writes while thinking about even one line of code.""""Ui/UX, RADSONE"" The reason I think so is that when the phone was a 2G phone, and when the computer was before Windows XP, they all used letters and keyboards like Lizz. However, the concept of a mouse was created, and you can intuitively see it by clicking and dragging. This was not just a UI/UX conversion, but an increase in usability and increased intuition. As such, I use my iPhone during the Bugs service, and unlike other services, if I press the category button, I can see it in a checkerboard format right away. So I think the good thing about Bugs is that it is easy to find other functions while using it. Another good thing about Bugs is its RADSONE technology. Anyone who finds and listens to music will want to hear it more vividly with a better sound. Also, there are times when you want to listen to a specific instrument better, or you want to pay the most attention to the vocals. Bugs provides a total of four sound modes and has the largest FLAC sound source in Korea. Therefore, I think the service that shows superior strength in sound quality is better than anywhere else. ""In the case of Bugs service, it is not distinguished by LTE/WIFI, but by setting it as streaming, there is an inconvenience that the sound quality must be continuously changed depending on the communication environment. "" If you don't think too much about sound quality, you can set it to the AAC+ low-capacity format. I think this is a disadvantage in the WIFI environment because when you want to listen to high-quality music, you have to change the music format every time the communication network changes. However, there is a music storage function as a countermeasure. If you have enough storage space, you can download music to your device and play music without using data. However, I think this is a disadvantage because this alternative method is difficult because the capacity is small when using a 16G iPhone like me.""- TODO Personalization Service 1) duration: 2016.12 ~ 2017.02 2) Key details: Establishment of a web service that records and manages personalization service 'My Halil.' 3) What I contributed: Development of servers based on Spring Framework 4) Skill or Knowledge: Spring Boot, MySQL, MyBatis, JSP, Jackie, J Unit, Jenkins 5) Result/Performance: Development process experience, production of Java-based web environment. - 2016 Energy Hackathon 1) Progress period: 2016.02) Main contents: Producing an energy-saving APP that can be used by checking electricity usage in advance 3) Contributing points: APP Developing an APP or Knowledge: Google TTS, Newtone API, EnerTalk API, Android, JAVA 5) Results/Performance: Grand Prize Winner - 15 years (prize) OO Development Capability Evaluation 1) Progressive contents: 2015.08.25 2) Main contents: Algorithm solution 3) Self-contributing points during software membership activities: Skills or knowledge: BFS, DFS, data structure, C, JAVA 5) Results/Performance: Acquiring intermediate (AM) grade - Participating in app production and research of OO Electronics' home appliance business (Smart Washer APP) 1) Progressive contents: Participating in the production of APP by OO Electronics' home appliance business in the first half of 2015 - Participating in the production of APP by OO Electronics' home appliance business in the first half of 2015 3) Contributing points: Producing washing machine information and data usage applications using NFC. 4) Skill or knowledge used: Android application production, DB connection, and weather API were used. 5) Results/achievements: favorable reviews during the internship process, experience in the development process, experience in implementing various Android functions - Other learning APP development through score recognition 1) Progress period: 2014.05~2014.082 Main content: When a user takes a picture of the desired score through video processing or selects it from the album, the appropriate guitar code is automatically generated, the accompaniment is played according to the code, and you can check how to pronounce the code. 3) What I contributed to: Making the Android part.

"""Important Value I Learned in a Hard Time"" When I just entered middle school, my family was very difficult due to the bankruptcy of my father's company. My parents were busy, and my sister was a high school student, so it was just my brother and I until 10 o'clock. Even though I was young, I thought that there was no one to protect my house except me, so I came back home right after school. I naturally learned responsibility and understanding by eating with my younger brother and sharing cleaning. Thanks to this, I was able to build a smooth teamwork by sometimes taking on the role of a responsible leader and sometimes a strong colleague during the project. ""How to succeed through challenge"" My biggest strength is the courage to challenge. When I was in high school, I was afraid to stand in front of people due to trauma. Rather, I thought that if I stand in front of more people, I will be able to overcome my fear, so I applied for the National Singing Contest. As a result, I failed, but I was not as afraid of standing in front of people as I used to be. After that, I learned how to succeed by challenging and failing whenever my fear was ahead of me. When it comes to network operation, I will become a talented person who leads innovation through various attempts. ""Checklist for meticulousness"" On the other hand, the downside is that I lack meticulousness in handling tasks. During my internship, I made a mistake of misspelling documents. Reflecting on my inability to check thoroughly, I made a list that I must check when writing documents. Afterwards, I got into the habit of following the checklist before submitting documents, and I was able to reduce my mistakes. After joining the company, I will make my own checklist and try to handle it meticulously. ""When I was in college, one of the games that I was responsible for my enjoyment was """"Tiny Farm."" Whenever I turned on the game, I used to feel good by coming across the logo with Com2u's unique smile on it. In order to give users constant pleasure, the story and cute characters of the game are important, but I think it is most important to provide seamless service. I applied to provide enjoyable game services to users who use Com2uS. My biggest advantage is that I can handle both network and script language at the same time. When the network is not large, it is not a big problem even if I check the equipment one by one and deal with the failure. However, there is a limit to operating the network manually when the size of the game increases and the number of games served increases. We will automate network operations step by step through the development of scripting capabilities, which is an advantage. Through this, we will try to make the network a solid foundation for Com2uS' business expansion in the future."""" ""I have three months of internship experience working at a network company."" During the internship, I monitored network networks around the world and learned basic troubleshooting, ip management, and impact management from work. By analyzing complex topologies, I learned the components of the network such as routing protocols, vlan, and ip, and learned security policies such as filter and acl. It also increased our understanding of network redundancy and improved stability through the structure of vrrp, glb, and spin-leaf. In addition to simply interpreting the created network, I have experience in designing and implementing the network myself. In gns3, we implemented a network connecting three as using Juniper and Cisco equipment. We used bgp, ospf, and static routing protocols, and we checked that the two hosts at the end communicate with each other through routing tables and ping tests. We can also handle script languages such as shellscript, java, c language, python. While we were working on it, we implemented a passwordless ssh connection through shellscript. After embedding the password in the script using the expect script, we made it enter the password automatically when we tried the ssh connection, and the result was successful. We will use these scripts to drive the automation of our operations to increase the efficiency of our network operations."",,"
"""Important Value I Learned in a Hard Time"" When I just entered middle school, my family was very difficult due to the bankruptcy of my father's company. Since my parents were busy and my sister was a high school student, it was just me and my sister until 10 o'clock. Even though I was young, I thought, ""There is no one to protect my home except me,"" so I came back home right after school. I naturally learned responsibility and understanding by eating meals with my younger brother and sharing the cleaning process. As a result, I was able to build a smooth teamwork by sometimes taking on the role of a responsible leader and sometimes a reliable colleague during the project. ""The power to overcome fear, challenge"" There was one trauma to me. When I was in elementary school, I was elected as the class president because of my friend's joke, but I was eliminated after receiving only four votes. The shame I felt at that time was hurt when I was young, and when I stood in front of the audience, my whole body trembled and I couldn't speak well. This personality affected me until the beginning of middle and high school, and when other friends focused on my presentation, my whole body would tremble less without realizing it. To overcome this, I applied to show off my best friend and the national song. To prevent me from getting nervous, I covered my face with a scarf and even put on sunglasses. I sang ""My Accidental Accident"" with the choreography in front of more than 500 people, and I proudly failed. However, there were audiences who laughed at the performance, and it was a fun stage for me as well. Through this, I learned how to overcome trauma and enjoy being nervous. There were several times when I was nervous when I took the SAT or when I presented a project, but I used to get better results than when I practiced. To overcome a problem, it is my philosophy of life to confront it head-on. I will develop myself by bumping and breaking it, and fully absorb what I have realized. ""Up my professionalism with concentration"" My biggest strength is that I have good concentration. When I fall into one thing, I often fall into it so that I can't see my surroundings well. When I was an undergraduate, there was a project that soldered to form a circuit, and I had the experience of finishing soldering in just one day. Thanks to this, I was able to focus more on coding projects afterwards. This personality will contribute to developing my expertise in InnoWireless, and further developing the company's technology. I will concentrate better than anyone else, saving time to eat and working on developing skills. ""A ""perfectionist"" One of my biggest weaknesses is that I try to complete every little thing perfectly. In my fourth year of college, I had time to take a mock interview and fill out a survey at a job center. At that time, other classmates answered simply within a line, but I wrote down everything I felt and the basic line was over three to four lines. The problem took that much longer and all the classmates had to wait for me to finish. I repeatedly understood that I was in a ""simple deficit"" due to their stinging eyes, but I was finally able to let go of my pen when I was done speaking. This was helpful for the development of the job center, but it could hurt the feelings of my classmates. Later, I regained my relationship with them, saying, ""I'm sorry to have kept you waiting."" I will work hard for the company, but I will maintain good relationships with seniors, colleagues, and juniors who work together with my unique knuckles and closeness. ""One complete product made by 10 errors"" I have experience producing ""Smart CCTV"" through Raspberry Pi and C language design during my undergraduate years. Since it is inefficient for a person to control CCTV 24 hours a day, we have implemented a function of self-judging a dangerous situation, informing the manager, and recording the video. First, connect the Raspberry Pi with the camera and then perform image processing using an open CV. When an object approaches, the image processing result is notified to the main server and the video is sent. In this process, I took charge of socket communication between Raspberry Pi and the main server and took the role of implementing it in C language. We designed with Raspberry Pi as a client and the team member's laptop as a server, and used TCP/IP protocol. We used WLAN (WIFI) and gstreamer for video streaming. It was successful to connect the server and the client, but there was a problem with video streaming. After the screen was displayed for 2-3 seconds, the program stopped with memory-related errors. To solve the problem, I looked up books about open CV and gstream in the library, and I even got advice from people I study with. As a result of my efforts, I found that I only imported the video from the while door that fetched the frame and did not release it. As a result, memory shortages occurred and the program was terminated. Later, by releasing variables, I was able to solve the memory shortage problem. When I work, I believe that there will be more errors than successful ones in the development process. I will read and grasp the company's previous development documents carefully to correct these errors, and become a new employee who develops by listening to seniors more precious than ever before. I found InnoWireless very attractive in three aspects: ""Aptitude, vision, and corporate culture."" The first is aptitude. As an engineering student, I had a high interest in network development to the extent that I studied communications on my own. It is a dream of mine since I was an undergraduate school to strive to develop next-generation communication technologies such as CDMA, WCDMA, and small cell at InnoWireless. To this end, I am ready to do not mind high-intensity work or overtime. The second is the vision of the company. Under the vision of being a world-class company, InnoWireless is investing boldly in technology development rather than immediate big profits. For example, he was selected as a small cell supplier for telecommunications companies and became the first in the world to commercialize small cell technology, proving the high technological prowess of the company.We decided that it is a company that has the power to leap to become a world-class company through the virtuous cycle of investment, technological improvement, and value-added creation. The third is the corporate culture. I believe that the characteristics of InnoWireless's corporate culture are 'fairness' and 'emphasis on talent'. Above all, I felt that it was a well-motivated environment for self-development in that it provided specific standards and compensation for judging performance. In addition, I was able to feel the careful consideration of developers as welfare benefits for the operation of dormitories, provision of meals and healthcare. Through these three things, I applied as I thought we could grow together in mutual trust.""""Three Promises for Growth Recently, mobile operators are not only seeking to expand coverage but also to improve service quality through efficient management of surging data traffic. To this end, they are making great efforts to develop new technologies and secure frequencies. I believe that one of the technologies that should be supported in order to develop these new technologies is OAM technology for wireless networks. After joining the company, I will try to secure the best OAM technology in Korea. First, I will adapt to my work by listening to the seniors' bitter words. I think what is much more valuable than learning through books is the words of seniors who come into contact with practical work. I will write down this carefully and find my own manual that I look for whenever I get stuck in my work. Second, I will try to acquire new skills by reading ten professional books a year to improve my professionalism. Europe's network technology is one step ahead of Korea's. I will study how to acquire advanced knowledge through original texts and papers and add them to the company's technology at all times. Third, I will work hard on the education of juniors. I think that for sustainable development, consistent training of juniors should be carried out. When all four wheels of a car run together, a car can move forward. For the development of InnoWireless, I will listen to the seniors and work hard to cultivate juniors below."""
"[Importance of collaboration with other companies] I was interested in the database field, so I took the 'Big Data Manager' course organized by the IT Business Promotion Association of Korea as well as the department class and carried out projects such as Java programming and data architecture design. While working on the project with students from various departments, I was able to hear various opinions on things that I did not think of or missed. I think that cooperation with other companies is important as well as the company's technology. Samsung has affiliates in the fields of electronics, finance, and heavy industry. Collaboration with the former and the financial sector can increase the competitiveness of the service and create synergies. In addition, Samsung Electronics is actively promoting cooperation with foreign companies such as the U.S. and Europe, so I applied because I thought there was a great potential for development. My dream at Samsung Electronics is to become the first in the world share of the program I made. I think a good program should be able to easily use the functions that the user needs. While programming, I always thought about the user's position.""[What Mathematics Problem Solving and Programming have in common] I have liked solving math problems since I was young. No matter how difficult a problem was, the process of solving it by substituting basic formulas and principles felt enjoyable, and this was the reason why I chose the natural world and chose engineering when I went to college. However, object-oriented programming that I took in my first year of college felt different from solving math problems. The screen in English felt like a different language, and I didn't think there would be rules. So, I went to the military with poor grades in the first grade programming subject, and while I was taking classes related to programming, I was forced to take a course called system programming due to failure in registration. It was a class that I entered belatedly, so I often visited the professor to ask for a class registration and to ask questions about the previous class, and this led me to focus on the class. What I felt while learning the C language in the system programming subject was similar to solving a math problem. Code, which I thought was just a list of English words, had a rule, and the process of using the rule to output the desired result value was as interesting as solving a math problem. The fact that I had to spend a lot of time to find single letter mistakes, minor mistakes in the use of phrases, and the fact that external problems other than code problems occurred sometimes felt difficult, but all of these processes gave me an opportunity to improve my programming skills. Since then, I became interested in programming and had a dream of becoming a developer. [How to work together in a strange job] I took a leave of absence to go on a trip to Europe, which was my dream since I was a third grader at university. And I immediately worked for two months at the Samsung Semiconductor Research Institute in Suwon to save money. At first, I was very tired from unfamiliar work, and it was even more difficult to work with strangers all day long. I didn't go home, but lived in a lodging house, so I had to wait more than an hour for me to wash up after work, and I just felt uncomfortable going to bed. However, the more I worked, the more enjoyable my team members who were close to each other, and I envied the more they were recognized for completing and taking responsibility for the work. So from the next day, I went first, talked to him, hung out, and if there was anything I didn't know, I started first, and tried to ask him exactly. When I opened up, it didn't take long for us to get to know each other. Since then, the work has become a little more enjoyable and I have felt a lot of rewarding like never before. No matter what kind of work I do, I have found that if I have a good relationship with the person I work with, I can work more happily and the efficiency of my work increases. Since then, whenever I want to achieve my goals by collaborating with someone, I have always tried to maintain a good relationship with people."",""[Big Data Analysis and Prediction] Among the recent social issues, the issues that I am interested in are big data analysis and prediction. Big data prediction is the prediction of what is most likely to occur statistically based on the collected data. As the analysis and prediction of unstructured data such as SNS and reviews increase, as well as structured data, many areas are used, many issues arise regarding big data analysis. The first is the accuracy of big data prediction. In order to increase the accuracy of big data, I believe that individual analysis and prediction are as important as those of a large number of people. Unlike in the past, when similar people gathered to work, individual diversity of people is respected as people with diverse thoughts gathered to create synergy. In big data analysis, it will be more important to make predictions by analyzing a person's consumption patterns, hobbies, and eating habits rather than by analyzing a large number of people of similar age and place of residence. Rather than analyzing a large number of data unconditionally, I think it is necessary to provide a prediction service tailored to each individual through various aspects of analysis. I think cooperation with other companies is necessary because it is necessary to collect user data through various routes. The second issue is the invasion of privacy in big data analysis. In this regard, I believe that strengthening the security of data should be prioritized. The value of data is increasing because big data prediction tends to increase in accuracy as the number of data increases. However, if data that you do not want to be collected is collected and used for analysis in the process of collecting data, you may think it is an invasion of privacy. That is why I think we need to strengthen the security of our data."",,,,"
"I have been exercising ever since I was young. I won several awards at the Gyeonggi Taekwondo Competition when I was in elementary and middle school, and won the club wrestling competition when I was in high school. Through my athletic career, I learned the lifestyle of robbing and waking up quickly even if I failed, and also the open personality to live a harmonious life with any organization or members. Based on my personality, I took the position of general manager or team leader in various projects such as government projects and contests, and put a lot of effort into harmony and synergy with my team members. As a result, I was awarded the Excellence Award in various competitions, and even after the project was over, I met them periodically, and became an opportunity to make essential colleagues in my college life."" When I was in the 2nd and 3rd grades, I was teaching at the school's practice room and setting and managing the development environment on about 200 classroom computers every semester. I joined a development company in Seocho, Seoul, based on my experience teaching myself after seeing my junior do an Android app that felt distant. I developed push alarms and banner image parsing functions, and documented the functions I was in charge of. It was an experience where I could see and learn many things, including not only my major knowledge, but also the leadership that the development team leader leads the team, and how development proceeds in practice. Fortunately, I gathered three key talents and formed a team within the university. I participated in the OO competition as a team leader and developed and operated as a Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP) as a project planning, management, and backend developer. In addition, I led the same team and participated in the ~~ competition, and received two Excellence Awards at the end of the year."",""""While taking the composition class, I still felt that musicians had more discomfort than I thought."" I think this applies not only to musicians. Based on my technological prowess, I want to become an appropriate technology developer through understanding and empathy in various fields. For this goal, I have the following career development. First, I plan to challenge the first-class Linux master test. I think it will be a great help for TIMEX software, a powerhouse in the domestic middleware market. Second, I will achieve win-win development among colleagues by conducting a study. I have experience in organizing algorithm studies with the support of the in-school teaching and learning support center and improving the ability of the study team members as the team leader. Based on this experience, I want to achieve win-win development with members. Third, I plan to do various community activities. Many seniors and professors say in unison that not only technical skills but also understanding and empathy in the field make better programs. As an engineering student, I would like to use my experience of minor in composition to contribute to the Tmax R&D business from a broad perspective."", I worked on the project by learning one by one through the introductory Linux book and Googling, even though I was not aware of the server's owner. While developing REST API to communicate with mobile, I am attracted to Shell and VIM and want to become a Linux server expert. In particular, I think Tmax Soft and my vision, which are doing well in the domestic SW industry with SW technology, are looking in the same direction.????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"
"Among the usual convenience store businesses, GS Retail's convenience store had a positive image as it was the most cost-effective store. Even if you buy a triangular kimbap, other companies only offer discounts on the price of drinks, but GS25 gave you small joys such as gifts. Seeing how they studied the taste, cost-effectiveness, and trend of lunch boxes and fresh foods through the FF research center, I was deeply impressed by GS Retail's craftsmanship, which focuses on quality rather than marketing and advertising. ""I found that I enjoy learning new technologies that I had no idea about or am interested in in in the computer engineering department. When I first got a smartphone in my freshman year, it was a shock like a new world. So, I wanted to create a program that I could use on my smartphone, so I looked for courses in C language, Java, and Android lectures and app, Inventor courses at universities. Not satisfied with it, I wanted to experience how apps were developed in a working environment, so I went to the suburbs to give lectures on Android by the KISA and field trips at start-up companies. The experience of making my own in-depth Android knowledge and experience, such as parsing, DB management, market upload, profitable marketing skills, gave me interest, vitality, and fun in the IT industry. Beyond learning these new technologies, the movement that aims for application will not stop even after I join the company."" After joining GS Retail, I want to work in the IT mobile department, which will benefit from my experience as a college student. When I saw the GS25 app currently on the market, I had original ideas such as refrigerator and point accumulation, but it really hurt me to see that many customers gave me 1 out of 5 stars when installing the app, because they required too much authority, used too many resources, and had frequent errors. If I join the company, I would like to create an edge browser instead of Explorer, which will perform better, and take the example of how I could ignore legacy codes that I have followed since the old version, and develop the app from scratch to optimize and stabilize functions so that it can function smoothly regardless of which customer's smartphone is. This is because stability and scalability are indispensable elements in websites, apps, and programs.""""I think my strength is the affinity I gained through various challenges and experiences. I didn't have this competitive edge to start with. After failing to retake the job, I was so clumsy that I was rejected as a part-time job seeker. So I thought I needed to change, so I applied for a theater club where I communicated with the audience with my whole body. In addition, I decided that I needed skills to socialize with people of various characteristics, so I gained a lot of experience by applying for the Marine Corps. Now, I can approach anyone and continue the conversation, and I can freely express my opinion. What needs to be corrected is concentration. As I couldn't sit for a long time and my grades dropped until the first semester of my third year, I recruited study personnel to attend the library and certify my study time, thereby creating motivation to focus. In addition, I successfully received an A+ in my major subject for the first time after making efforts to pack two meals for efficient time management."" ""My experience of learning the power of honesty was when I participated as a mentor at a basic educational center on campus. The goal was to improve the academic ability of first-year students who could not complete required liberal arts courses. At that time, I had a lot of learning ahead of my senior year, so I could start preparing for mentoring at 2 a.m. But one of my juniors told me that sometimes they only met one mentor, took a certified photo, and received the support fee without a single class. However, my ethical value is, 'Always be proud of yourself,' and I never intended to break it just for convenience. So I thought about how to teach them efficiently in a short period of time, and organized and taught them what I needed to learn in my senior year in high school, TOEIC, and TOEIC Speaking. As a result, I got first place in my special semester test. From this experience, I have deeply learned that honest efforts can overcome challenges no matter how hard they are."",,,,"
"[Start of Communication] The values in life are 'Let's communicate.' These values were formed from the time I was in elementary school. I served as the president when I was in the fourth grade. I started communicating with the teacher by giving her suggestions and complaints. The teacher took appropriate measures accordingly, and delivered her words to her friends as well. Through this, I was able to create a good atmosphere in my class and finish the school year without any accidents. Through these experiences, I learned the importance of communication, and I was able to further improve my communication skills by serving as the president in the fifth, sixth, and middle schools. [Clear after Rain] In 2015, I had an experience of breaking through the competition ratio of 21:1 by demonstrating the power of communication that I had formed when I was young. I participated in the OO Global Challenger by forming a team with my friends in the fields of IT, electrical and electronics, and industrial engineering. However, I had difficulty in deciding on a topic because my interests were different due to different majors. I was able to decide on a topic in the following way. First, I had a meeting with my team members every day. They came to topics that matched everyone's major and discussed which of the various topics was practical and objective. Second, I listened carefully to my opinions. Rather than deciding independently as a leader, I set a common goal by listening to my team members' stories. In this process, I was motivated and could come up with more ideas. Based on this method, I was able to decide on a topic that covers everyone's major. After the topic was decided, several majors could gather and approach it from various perspectives. Based on the synergy effect, I came up with a practical and objective topic, and I was able to pass the document screening process through the competition ratio of 21:1. [Life of communication] I think the definition of communication is 'achievement'. Because of good communication with my team members, I was able to achieve my goal and achieve good results. If I had good results by launching good services, I think I was able to communicate well with customers because I understood their needs well. After joining the company, Dow Technology will show good results not only through customer stories but also through communication with internal employees and related technology companies."" [Dreaming Developer] I made the following efforts to become a program developer. First, I took courses in C, C++, Java, and Android. Through this, I was able to deal with various languages and learn the differences between each language. In addition, the practice was conducted based on the assignment. We produced 'search word ranking program' using C++, 'shopping shopping mall program' using Java, 'mini-game heaven' using Android, and 'Please take care of a working mom'. In addition, 'unmanned parking' project was carried out through the Opencv library and C++ language. I experienced various types of languages based on various practice. Second, I learned the basics and skills of programming through data structure, algorithm, and database subjects. We dealt with algorithms and data structures through algorithm problem sites. Through this, we could learn how to design with an emphasis on optimization and efficiency. Third, we learned about Linux systems through the subjects of system programming, operating system, and embedded computing system. I worked on various projects based on the Linux system. As a graduation work, on the Raspian OS system, we conducted 'Smart Home for Working Mom' using Raspberry Pi and sensors. In addition, in the subject of 'embedded computing system', we conducted a router practice, which is an embedded board. We modified the device driver and controlled the function of the router. [Tennis club participated in many competitions] I worked in tennis club for 3 years as a club member. I learned tennis when I was a freshman, and I became a senior and taught tennis to my juniors. I led my juniors and participated in many tennis competitions. I participated in various competitions such as the National Tennis Club Competition held in Yanggu, Gangwon Province every summer, and the Gyeongin District, where universities from Seoul, Gyeonggi Province, and Incheon participated, so college students from all over the country with the same hobbies gathered and played tennis games to improve their skills. By learning tennis, which is called etiquette sport, I was able to develop respect and consideration for others. I also developed teamwork and communication skills between seniors and juniors."""" As I liked to meet people, I worked part-time at a service job mainly. 1. I worked at a bakery for 3 months. I was responsible for overall business of the store by myself, including customer service, counter work, cleaning the store, and bakery packaging. 2. I worked as an assistant for 13 months at the cram school. Due to the nature of the academy, I was able to meet customers of various ages, mainly targeting parents and students. In addition, I was able to feel the atmosphere of the actual company by using the same office as the employees and those in the general manager's position. As an intern, I worked as an intern at the graduate lab for a year. I mainly worked on the project based on the Linux system. 1. Based on Raspberry Pi and EV3, an automobile robot, the unmanned parking project was carried out by myself. On the Linux-affiliated Raspian operating system, OpenCV and cameras were used to detect the parking line. Through this, we implemented a system that automatically parks by controlling the speed of the wheel motor according to the location of the parking line. 2. As a graduation work, we conducted 'Smart Home for Working Mom' with two people using Raspberry Pi, various sensors, and Android. Based on Raspberry Pi and sensors, we composed gas valves, interphones, air conditioners, refrigerators, fluorescent lamps, and distributor smart home devices. We created the 'Please Take Care of a Working Mom' app and implemented a system that can control smart home devices with a smartphone. Among them, we played the role of developing various smart home devices. In addition, we built a web server to bring smart home devices together, and we were in charge of implementing Android and web servers for post communication.As a result, by implementing a highly completed system, I was among the top five teams out of 70 teams in the free competition for embedded software and won the Presidential Award by ranking first in the competition for excellence and graduation work on campus. The strength of this is responsibility. I have experience that impressed customers through part-time jobs at academies. This experience gave me the opportunity to be recognized by my employees, and I was able to feel a sense of belonging after working continuously for 13 months. Through this, I learned a lesson that if I do my best with responsibility in my duties, I can be recognized by my customers and internal staff. In 2013, I worked part-time as an assistant at an cram school. The assistant's main duties included student management, and the overall supervision of the institute, including House of Representatives, PC management, telephone reception, reading room management, and vending machine management. Among them, when giving guidance to the House of Representatives to ensure that students get on the bus home, the academy bus heading home departed home at the same time every day, and students rarely missed the bus. Then one day, I found a student who missed the bus. The bus had already left and was unable to go home, and the student said he did not know how to get home and had no money to take a taxi. I thought it was my assistant's role to guide the student to arrive home safely, so I decided to take the student home even during rush hour. I contacted the student's mother and asked her home address. I took a taxi with the student and left the house after finishing the House guidance. The next day, the student's mother thanked him and presented him with snacks and letters. This incident allowed me to receive praise and recognition from my staff. Also, whenever I went to the House guidance, I paid more attention to prevent the same thing from happening again. Through this, even after I quit my part-time job because of my studies, they called me whenever I needed a hand so I could constantly be recognized for my ability. Through this, I think that customer emotion is a 'responsibility'. This is because I was able to impress customers when I did what I had to do with responsibility. I will faithfully play my role based on responsibility at Dow Technology, which provides the best service for the impressions of customers. Through this, I will make efforts to expand the market while increasing the satisfaction of related technology companies and customers. The disadvantage [of meticulousness who received scholarships] is that I am meticulous and tend to be a bit late in handling work. I am usually meticulous and can't be satisfied when I work without being perfect. Due to the nature of engineering college, which has many assignments in each subject, when one assignment is completed completely, there were many cases where other assignments were submitted without completing them because the deadline was numbered. To overcome these shortcomings, we prioritize work and prioritize work that can be done quickly. Therefore, I received three scholarships by completing assignments and projects in all subjects. ""After joining the company, I will become a new employee who takes advantage of my strengths, complements my weaknesses, and demonstrates my abilities at Dow Technology."" My motto [8/128's achievements through hard work] is ""Let's make efforts."" If you make efforts, you will get good results in the end. Breaking away from the existing training method and applying a new training method, I became the first among 128 teams to achieve quarterfinals at the 2014 National Tennis Club Championships. When I was a member of a tennis club, I did not do well at the National Tennis Club Championships for several years. Ahead of the competition, club members lost their confidence and tried to put meaning into participation without a goal. As the guidance manager in charge of training, I thought that the reason why I could not perform well was a problem with the training method. I had a meeting with club members every week and set my goal of advancing to the finals, and through feedback, I changed the training method as follows. First, it is 'Experience.' The training method, which was focused on the basic skills, has been changed to focus on the actual games. In the training, each other practiced against each other and conducted the actual game, and after the game was over, they gave advice through feedback. Second, it is 'eye-level education.' In addition to regular lessons, we invited juniors who were not good at it and conducted customized training with them. I transferred their know-how, and I was able to develop my confidence through encouragement. Through this, I became closer between seniors and juniors, and I got the effect of killing two birds with one stone. Lastly, it is 'voluntary.' I trained every day two weeks ago, and changed the training date to three times a week from one month ago. This is because I thought consistency was more important than cramming. In addition, each was encouraged to voluntarily attend three times a week, thereby developing autonomy and responsibility. As a result, my skills and teamwork improved, and I was able to achieve the quarterfinals for the first time ever in a competition involving 128 university teams. Based on these experiences, I learned a lesson that you can achieve good results if you try hard without giving up. In addition, I was able to feel the importance of change without being bound by the existing methods. After joining the company, when there is a situation where the result is bad or difficult to solve, I will not give up and try to find a solution. Rather than doing it alone, I will discuss it with my team members and solve the problem by trying different ways without being afraid of change,"" said Lee. ""I was interested in new IT technologies, so I planned a smart home project. Because I dealt with areas and realities of my interests, I was able to feel interested and develop them, which led to my winning the prize. I think this experience is consistent with the direction of Dow Technology, which communicates with trust and challenges with expertise. After joining the company, Dow Technology will apply new IT technologies and release customer-oriented products that apply trends. I have experience working part-time at an cram school. One of the main tasks when I worked part-time was answering the phone calls from mothers who asked if the students arrived at the institute safely. Through this, I was able to understand the practical concerns of working mothers, and the biggest concern of working mothers is for working mothers who can keep their child safe at home alone"
"Netmarble, the cornerstone of mobile games, was introduced to countless games when using its first smartphone after being discharged from the military. At the time, mobile games showed two great possibilities. The first is accessibility. Even before smartphones were developed, there were many kinds of mobile games and companies, but accessibility was not good. However, the fact that games can be easily downloaded and played for free with just a few touches has changed to make it easier for users to access them. The second is profitability. By creating a system that allows users to download games for free and pay extra while playing, contents that can help them play were not burdensome for users in the store, and the developer thought that it was a good structure to make a profit. This idea gave me the determination to jump into the game industry after graduation. The times have changed rapidly and the game industry has grown rapidly. As a result, the innovation shown by your company has come in an extraordinary way. I think Netmarble's innovation has led to the base of Korea's current mobile games."""" ""Jukmagou"" ""Stone Age"" with 10 years of experience. ""Stone Age"" is an attractive game that I can't let go of yet, as I came across after watching the movie Jurassic Park when I was in the sixth grade of elementary school. First, the elements that I had fun playing Stone Age for 10 years were the progress of the game on a turn-based basis. The game in which enemies appeared randomly when there was movement in the field and played on a turn-based basis made it easy for adults to play with a simple manipulation method. Second, there is a pet growth rate system. It was fun to raise one pet each because the growth rate was applied differently to each pet, and the range of growth was different depending on the properties of the same petra. Lastly, it is a reincarnation system. If you raised a character to a certain level, you could be reincarnated through a mission, but you could receive a pointer after reincarnation based on the stat distributed to the character before reincarnation or whether the mission was completed. I believe that this reincarnation system provided a foothold for the players to build stronger and stronger characters, and continued to play for a long time. ""Scholarship You're Mine"" After the first semester of my freshman year, I looked at my report card and tuition bill and set my goal for college life as a full scholarship. I can't forget how I felt sorry for my parents at the time. However, in the second semester of my freshman year, I repeated failures and went to the military. After being discharged from the military, I decided to set strategies and change methods. Unlike when I just sat down and memorized things, I did communication and projects through question-and-answer methods and study groups, increasing my participation in class. However, even though I got a score higher than 4.3 in the first and second semesters of my sophomore year and the first semester of my junior year, I didn't receive the full scholarship that only one student received. Still, I worked hard and achieved the goal of full scholarship from the second semester of my junior year to the graduation semester. Like all students, I wasn't very interested in my studies. However, through this work, I realized that effort requires a method, and in the end, persistent effort is the most important.""I think the most important thing in the modern constructivist paradigm is communication. It has become an era in which cooperation between multiple people produces better results than a single genius idea. I have experienced the success of collaborative thinking while working on a team project in college. At that time, the progress of the project was decreasing due to a disagreement between the team leader and the team members. The deadline and progress of each part of the project did not match, and the limit was reached. So, I took on the shortcomings of the team members and tried to complete the project by persuading each team member again to complete the part. Naturally, I took on the role of the team leader, led the overall progress of the project, giving presentations, questions, and answers to the presentation, and bringing out good results and harmony among the team members. ""Challenge through experience"" Everyone sets the direction of life, but they don't always go where they want to go. However, the person who achieves what they have planned is called a successful person. I learned that hard work changes lives even with my life so far. When I first encountered the game on Netmarble and played it until now, I thought that I was working in a related job at any time. I will not be frustrated even if Netmarble does not join the company. As usual, I will think about my shortcomings and what I need to develop and implement them without hesitation. First, I will build a career in a competitive but small-scale mobile company, go overseas and gain 'experience' that I lack the most from various people. Through this experience, I will gain skills and receive offers from your company."","""" Computer Basic and Practice, Logic Circuit, Programming Language and Practice I, Data Structure and Design, Big Data Entrance, Program Language and Practice II, Engineering Design Entrance, Programming Writing Techniques, UNIX Programming, Software Engineering, Application Programming, Information.

In class, I developed a mobile application with my team members. Many students live alone around the school, so they usually order delivery food, but there are not many flyers, so it is difficult to order. Thus, I came up with an application that can provide menus, price information, and phone numbers to restaurants around the school. One of the additional functions along with the market research was the coupon system. Since each restaurant does not have a constant expiration date and longevity, it was developed so that the application can use it in a single coupon to make it easier for students to use it. We designed a circular image so that users can get closer and have a UI in the form of a mind map.When a user presses the desired menu and finds a restaurant that corresponds to the menu, the user's name, address, and phone number are displayed along with the picture of the restaurant. At first, only the team members used it, but gradually began to use it in the department, and the friends complimented me, ""I don't have to go looking for flyers anymore."" Through those words, I still can't forget how I felt when things that had been struggling at the time were unraveling. ,,,,"
"""Creating something out of nothing."" Since I was a child, I have been praised for having unique ideas by surprising people around me by drawing pictures of future undersea cities, food, and fashion that others have never imagined. I became interested in programming that allowed me to freely realize these unique ideas and naturally went on to major in computer science. In order to develop a new concept of service that others could not come up with, I tried to build up my competence as a developer by completing a number of programming expert courses at Academy O, an educational institution for development experts as well as majoring in universities. As the first step toward surprising the world with unique ideas, I founded a fashion shopping mall called OO a year ago. It was intended to provide customers' trust and convenience through an operation method called ""pre-check-and-pay"" that differentiates it from the existing shopping mall called ""pre-check-and-check."" In addition, through the concept of providing personalized styling services, we tried to be competitive with existing shopping malls, and targeted niche markets by making men rather than women the main customers. Naturally, this became the first opportunity in the shopping mall industry to realize individual male O2O styling services, and returns and refunds were 4% lower on average than competitors. Based on these results, I was able to get an opportunity to be selected as a nurturing startup of OOO. However, despite these achievements, I encountered unexpected difficulties while developing the service due to the disadvantage of trying to solve any problem alone. During the implementation of the payment system, the PHP-based code sample and manual provided by the payment PG company were very different from the server platform Node.js, which is the server platform I implemented, so it was difficult to implement. I tried to find PHP programming books and internet search, but I wasted five days. Eventually, I asked the payment PG company for help through phone call and e-mail, and I felt a great sense of despondency when I learned that it was a problem that could be solved easily in just a day. With this as an opportunity, I am trying to solve the problem quickly by asking and learning who the target person is. Although there were many difficulties while developing the service due to its shortcomings, the responsibility of being the ""owner of the service"" was the driving force behind the commercialization of the shopping mall service. It was not an easy task to develop the front/back-end of the service by myself because I was the only developer in a startup team composed of various majors. However, this startup was started with my idea, and I was able to implement and commercialize the service within the target period after staying up all night at the office for three months with a sense of responsibility that no one else could take charge of development. Through the start-up of the fashion shopping mall, I practiced ""passion"" and ""challenge"" by creating the first men's personal styling service that could not be found in existing shopping malls, and I was able to cultivate ""professionalism"" to run out of school to develop solid services and gain professional competence by directly entering educational institutions for development professionals. [The determination to walk 800 kilometers in person for 24 days] My hobby is trekking. A year ago, I had the experience of completing the 800-km pilgrimage route in Spain by walking my own feet. I was challenged to overcome my weak willpower that could not end anything. Since I had to walk 800 kilometers in person for about a month, I have improved my physical strength through constant exercise since six months before the challenge. In addition, I prepared in advance so that there would be no difficulty in the journey by studying the route of the pilgrim, the culture, and the language of Spain. Contrary to the expectations that the first day of the journey would be enjoyable, the process of crossing the Pyrenees, located on the border between Spain and France, was very difficult and made me even want to give up. When I found my first accommodation across the Pyrenees, I felt proud and delighted that I had completed anything, which was easily giving up on anything. I wasted my day on the wrong route during the journey, got picked up by a pickpocket at a village festival, had problems with my travel budget, and I often wanted to give up due to numerous difficulties, such as walking 30 km with a heavy body wearing a raincoat on a rainy day. However, whenever I encountered these difficulties, I focused and focused only on walking with the will to finish it somehow. After 24 days of walking without giving up, we arrived at our destination, Santiago, and my heart was filled with memories of overcoming difficulties on our last journey. Through the path of pilgrims, I was able to discover myself the determination to finish everything off without giving up."" ""Two years ago to gain practical development skills in addition to lectures at the school, I completed various programming professional courses at the O Academy, an educational institution for development professionals. In about six months of training at the O Academy, I took professional courses in Android, mobile servers, and databases. And I experienced two mobile app development projects that I aimed to commercialize using them. The subject I found most interesting at the O Academy was Android. Java was the most proficient language of my undergraduate years, and Android, a platform based on Java, naturally felt comfortable to me. The free expression of the GUI through Android programming even made me feel like an artist who paints on a blank sheet of paper. I was also delighted that I had developed a client that could communicate with the server for the first time by implementing a Network Manager module that Post/Get with the server. While developing the Network Manager module, the process of parsing information transmitted to the Json data structure of the server's Restful API service gave the impression that it was decoding a secret. Based on this Android programming, a project team was formed to develop a crowdfunding platform service for abandoned dogs.It wasn't easy to get out of the position of being taught by someone and into a position of having to do it yourself. Especially for me, who is new to designing the architecture of Android systems, it felt difficult and complicated to draw the big picture of the service. As I worked on UX/UI with the designer and collaborated with the server developer to realize it after all, I was able to gain confidence in my career as a developer as I saw myself completing each function. In addition, through this project, I was able to gain a sense of responsibility to act as an expert in my role in a team of people in various fields, professionalism, and communication skills to coordinate opinions through smooth communication when I had conflicts with team members.""""

"SK Encar has the industry's best used car quality guarantee service called Encar Warranty, and a ""Hutstep Compensation System"" for victims who purchase bait products or false items, confirming that SK Encar puts customer trust first. In addition, statistics that about 1 million cars are registered annually and the number of online and mobile visitors exceeds 400,000 every day show that customers already trust SK Encar. [Challenging to start a business based on customer trust] I think I look a lot like SK Encar in that I value customer trust as my top priority. When I was an undergraduate, I had the experience of conceiving and starting a shopping mall where customers could buy clothes with confidence. Unlike conventional shopping malls, which check products offline after paying online in advance, we came up with a customer-reliable shopping mall operation method in which clothes are delivered offline first and then paid online on the spot. In addition, by allocating one stylist per customer, we made it possible to solve customers' concerns about styling through a messenger in the app. After the commercialization of the service, I was able to get a lot of advice on styling from customers who actually used the service, and I heard that I could trust it because I could try it on and pay first. As a result of practicing this customer trust first, only 4% of all payments were returned or refunded. We have applied to SK Encar to show the customer trust-based service development capabilities experienced through the start-up of a clothing shopping mall at SK Encar, which puts customer trust first. I think SK Encar service, which customers can trust and use, is possible only when it is based on solid software technology. To this end, in the short and long term, I promise to become an employee as follows. [In line with the big data era], I will try to become an expert in the big data field, which has recently become important. We will acquire various big data technologies such as automobile and used car market analysis, machine learning, deep learning, Spark, and Hadoop, which are big data analysis algorithm technologies to identify and convey consumer trends, and apply them to SK Encar's web and mobile application services. SK Encar's service applied with big data technology will contribute to innovating consumers' automobile life. [Trying to develop various services] SK Encar will constantly challenge to develop innovative and diverse services to get closer to consumers' car life. We will systemize the essential elements of car life, such as installment financing, car washing, maintenance, and vehicle renovation, as well as vehicle purchase and sales services. To this end, we will actively embrace new IT technologies and actively practice leading service development. Through this, we will try to become SK Encar that provides higher quality and convenience to our customers. [Preparation for Global Market] Based on know-how accumulated through experience in the online/offline car sales business in Korea, SK Encar will become an employee who will lead the global expansion to realize customer impressions beyond the trust of customers around the world. To this end, we will continue to improve our foreign language skills so that SK Encar can expand overseas at any time."" [Teamwork learned through club activities] During the winter vacation of my third year at university, I studied Android programming with the desire to commercialize the program I developed myself. I joined the EP Development Association Club OO because I thought it would be fun to develop it with many people rather than alone. OO was an external club composed of not only computer engineering students but also various university students such as business, philosophy, English literature, and design. These members were classified into planners, designers, and developers, and they formed a team and selected a topic to develop an app. In the meeting on what kind of app to make in the first team, we each expressed our opinions on the app we wanted to create. I always wanted an app that comprehensively stores and manages favorite URL strings set through Internet browser apps such as Google and Naver. Accordingly, I presented this to my team members and started to create an app with the function with the consent of the team members. At the beginning of the project, when designing functions and screens with my team members, they drew pictures on a blank sheet of paper, and each came up with a lot of strange but popping ideas. Seeing that designers or planners put out screen compositions or functions that I couldn't come up with, rather than developers, I realized why a team project should consist of people from various fields. It was a situation where the design of both the function and the UX was completed and the app was only developed. However, it was more difficult to implement the function than I thought, and in the end, the app could not be developed within the period. Due to the great feeling of self-blame and responsibility that I did not fulfill my role, I entered T Academy, a development expert education institution, and completed the Android and mobile server expert course for 6 months in order not to repeat these mistakes. I led the study by serving as the study group leader to share the middle and high-end Android technologies I learned at T Academy with the club developer team members. Through this, the development capabilities of all club developers were improved, and most of the teams were able to implement the applications envisioned in the team project that was conducted later. I have a lot of experience not only in internal activities of the club but also in external activities. I have participated in competitions or idea competitions several times with my club members. The 2014 Samsung Gear 2 hackathon competition is the most memorable of them. This competition was to develop Tizen OS-based applications that run on Samsung Electronics' Gear 2 products for 1 night and 2 days. A week before participating in the competition, we are fully prepared, including selecting the topic of the application, selecting the members, and dividing the roles. The theme is to develop a navigation application on the wrist for the visually impaired.In order to fulfill my role in development at the time, I applied for a Tizen programming book as a desired book at the school library and prepared for the competition by self-taught. On the day of the competition, we developed applications in a way that matched our roles. Although the competition was given a tight deadline to sleep one night and two days, we were able to complete the application development by the time the next morning's sunrise by relying on each of our team members. Perhaps because of my efforts, I won the OO Award for highly social contribution application among the outstanding teams of competitors. I still remember the impression that 'all of this was possible because of the cohesiveness of the team members.' Through the OO club, I was able to learn the sense of cooperation that unites toward the same goal as team members and the sense of responsibility that each member must work on the project with a sense of ownership in order to implement it were also good experiences. ""I was praised for having unique ideas since I was young. I became interested in programming that allowed me to freely realize these unique ideas, and naturally, I majored in computer engineering during college. As the first step to surprise the world with unique ideas, I started a fashion shopping mall called 'OO'. In order to differentiate myself from the existing shopping mall operation method of pre-payment and confirmation, I came up with a rather unconventional operation method of payment after pre-payment. In addition, in line with the recent trend of increasing interest of male office workers in styling, we came up with a personal styling service with male office workers as our main customers. After the commercialization of the service, it gained the reputation of being the first O2O service in the shopping mall market and was selected as a nurturing start-up company of OO. Through my startup activities, I gained confidence that my unique idea can inspire people greatly. However, there were also difficulties in these achievements. Due to my shortcomings that I did not rely well on others, I encountered unexpected difficulties in the middle of service development. Once the payment system was implemented, the service could be commercialized. I had no experience in implementing the payment system, so I tried to implement it by looking at the code samples and manuals of the payment PG. While the code samples and manuals provided by PG were PHP-based, the server platform I developed was unable to obtain relevant information because it was Javascript-based Node.js. I wasted 5 days trying to solve this problem alone, but I couldn't. Eventually, I asked PG for help through phone or e-mail, visited the practitioner in person, and learned it, and I learned that it was a problem that could be solved simply in a single day. If there is something I don't know to compensate for the shortcomings of not relying on others for my ignorance, whether the target is a senior or a junior, I am trying to build up my quick competencies by approaching first, asking and learning. I think OO was possible because of my advantage of 'keeping the principles even if it is urgent'. In development, I did not overlook the important design and the principle of documentation based on it. From the beginning of the design, we designed and analyzed the functions necessary for the service with the planner to document the Restful API and DB table structure. I thought this was an essential principle for the expansion and efficient management of the system structure in the future. I conceived UX/UI together with the designer and made the design guide line for the efficiency of UX layout development. By documenting the initial functional design, unnecessary function implementation was prevented in advance and time was not wasted. In addition, we were able to reduce the designer's effort by developing it by referring to the relevant document without asking the designer one by one during UX implementation with the design guide line document. Thanks to this, we were able to complete and commercialize the service about a month earlier than the initial planned development period. In addition, I think the responsibility of being the owner of the service was the driving force behind OO. I was the only developer in the college student start-up team consisting of various majors such as management, design, and fashion. Obviously, developing the service's Front/Back-End system by myself was not easy. However, I developed the service all-night for three months in the office with the responsibility that no one else could take charge of the development because it was started with my idea. Because of my principles and responsibility, I was able to realize my idea, OO, and I was able to have a valuable experience of starting a business."",,"
"I applied to IT OO Academy to learn programming and work in the IT industry, which I was usually interested in. When I was young, there was a token on the city bus, and when I took the subway, I used paper tickets. But now, it is a world where people pay directly with their cell phones. IT technology has completely changed how we live our lives over the past 20 years, and I have been very interested in new technologies since I was a child, and I would like to know how IT can change our lives in the future. I took various classes while attending the Department of Statistics, but what I was most interested in was the Statistical Programming class. It was really interesting to write R or SQL codes and derive results. I also studied statistical programming when I had a conference in a big data club. I used R and PYTHON to do internal tasks. I was interested in coding, so I personally studied C and PYTHON. ""I attended the Department of Statistics and took a Statistical Programming class. I learned R and SAS through computer data processing classes, and I learned MSSQL by taking data analysis and design classes. I also took many classes using a programming language in other statistics classes. In the second half of 2014, I worked as an intern at OO for half a year. I learned two survey coding languages based on java script and immediately used them in the field. After finishing the internship, I joined a big data club and worked for 10 months. I studied R in the club and also learned PYTHON for data processing, so I learned website crawling, natural language processing, and data handling using packages. While working as an OO intern in the second half of 2016, I performed the task of extracting and analyzing data from the server through SAS."", ""If I join LG CNS, I will first do my best to increase my programming skills for work. I will continue to study my background knowledge about the fields I will work with and combine them with my programming skills so that I can get better results. Not only will I do it right away, but I will be an employee who can learn ahead of time and help others without hesitation in accepting new things. Through my mindset that likes new things, I will try to become a talented person who can adapt no matter what job I take. In 10 years, my goal is to be in a leading position in the project based on my experience, ability, and communication ability to generate synergy, and my long-term goal is to become an expert that people can think of first in my field."",,,,"
"I have the experience of developing a fashion shopping mall based on the O2O structure a year ago. I applied because I thought that my development capabilities best fit SK Planet's O2O Platform development. As an engineer of SK Planet, I want to become an expert in O2O Marketing Platform architecture. We will open a new chapter in the consumption culture by providing optimized shopping information and convenient shopping experiences for individual customers, going back and forth between mobile and offline. In order to become an expert in O2O Marketing Platform architecture, I have built up my experience and competence in the development job with the mind of constantly challenging myself as follows. First, through the start-up experience, I realized the customer-oriented Platform service by understanding it from the customer's point of view through the start-up of a fashion shopping mall called OO, which practices customer-oriented business, and melting the customer's needs into the service. In addition, by developing an O2O Platform-type commerce service, I was able to understand and personally experience SK Planet's Platform Business philosophy. Second, improvement of development capabilities through T-Academy. In order to gain professional development capabilities, T-Academy, an educational institution for development experts operated by SK Planet, showed passion for completing two courses of experts in Android and mobile servers in succession. In addition to development capabilities, T-Academy has gained teamwork skills to solve problems with people in various fields, as well as understanding and communicating skills and communication skills through team projects. Third, after learning practical skills through internship at a solution company for 9 months, I experienced practical organizational culture and developed technical skills, responsibility, and perseverance that practical developers should possess. Through these capabilities, I will contribute to SK Planet becoming a global Platform Business company leading the global market.""[Self-Honoring] I have experience working as an intern at a company whose main business is producing LTE modem chips and developing solutions until recently. During my internship period, I had the opportunity to participate in a firmware development project for smart meters that send and receive data that measured the power consumption of each home to and from electricity companies. My role was to implement a socket server that received data on the amount of power measured by clients through socket communication. I was nervous because it was a relatively big task, but I decided with the responsibility of implementing it perfectly because the team members trusted me and entrusted it. Not long after I started developing the function I was in charge of, I encountered difficulties. When the socket server was initially implemented, the server handled the process of accepting the client's socket connection request in a blocking manner, and if two or more clients send packets at the same time, the server could not receive them in order, resulting in a file descriptor error. I tried to solve this problem alone, such as socket programming books and internet search, but I couldn't solve it and wasted three days. After suffering alone, I decided that it would have a big impact on the project deadline, so I ended up explaining the cause of the problem and what needs to be resolved to the senior developer within the team and asking for advice. I was advised by the senior developer that changing the part that was treated as a blocking structure to a non-blocking structure would solve the problem, and the code was modified with that structure. Since then, not only two but also 10 clients sent packets at the same time, no problem has occurred. Realizing that it was a problem that could be solved easily in just one day, I scolded myself for almost having a setback in the project's progress due to my pride in trying to solve it alone. With this opportunity, I try to solve a problem by myself for a day when it arises, and if it is judged that more time is required, I try to solve the problem quickly by asking and learning who the target audience is."""" In my third year of university, I joined the EP Development Association club 'OO' because I thought it would be fun to develop it with many people rather than alone. I felt a strong sense of belonging as I experienced many external activities such as contests and contests as well as active internal activities such as study and project at OO. The most memorable event during my activities was the OO Hackathon that I participated in 2014. The competition was to develop Tizen OS-based applications that run on OO products for one night and two days. A week before participating in the competition, we were fully prepared with the members of the club, including selecting an application topic, selecting members, and sharing roles. As the theme, we decided to develop a navigation app on the wrist for the visually impaired. My role at the time was to develop a function that sounds vibrations and notifications when the navigation map deviates from the path. In order to perform my role, I applied for a Tizen programming book at the school library as a desired book and prepared for the competition by self-study to myself. On the day of the competition, we developed applications according to our respective roles. Although the competition was given a tight deadline to sleep, one night and two days, we were able to complete the application development by the time the next morning's sun came out, relying on each other. Among the prominent working-level competitor teams, I won a special award for being an application with a high social contribution. As I was speaking at the acceptance speech, I still vividly remember the sentence, 'All of this was possible because of the cohesion of the team members'. Through the club OO, it was a good experience to learn the sense of cooperation that unites toward the same goals as team members and the responsibility that each member should work on the project with a sense of ownership."",""[The first men's personal styling service in a shopping mall, OO] A year ago, I challenged myself to start a fashion shopping mall named 'OO' with my colleagues who worked on a project together at OO. We tried to provide customers' trust and convenience through the operation method called 'Preliminary Payment' which is differentiated from the existing shopping mall called 'Preliminary Payment'. In addition, we tried to make it competitive with existing shopping malls through the concept of providing personalized styling services and targeted niche markets by making men rather than women their main customers. Naturally, this became the first opportunity for the shopping mall industry to realize individualized O2O styling services for men, and returns and refunds were 4% lower on average than competitors. Based on these results, we were able to get an opportunity to be selected as a nurturing startup of SK Planet. [Role in charge] ???

"AlphaGo, which has become a hot topic recently, shocked our society by winning against Lee Se-dol, Korea's top Go player. Big data is a big part of AlphaGo's decision-making method. As such, big data technology will gradually change society as a new way of making decisions. SK C&C has ICT capabilities for data collection and analysis, and is active in various fields of society based on big data solutions. I think big data technology will be the main food that will lead SK C&C's growth now and in the future. I learned about big data in the Department of Statistics, and I wanted to work in a big data club and handle data. Based on my statistical knowledge, statistical programming, and interest in big data, I want to increase my expertise in big data to contribute to SK C&C's big data capabilities. ""I have been a scholarship student at the school library for a total of one year since I was a freshman at the university. My job was to scan and edit old books. However, when I tried to use the scanner, it stopped roaring and I had to repeat the same task to scan one page. Nevertheless, because the scanners were expensive, I didn't dare to fix them, and everyone was scanning so slowly. Increasingly conscious of the problem with the slow speed of work, I started to find a solution. I observed the movement of the scanner when I pressed the scan button, and I studied why it wasn't working. After observing the scanner, I found that the machine lacked the power to move, and I found that if I pushed it by hand before it stopped, it would scan normally. Although there was an inconvenience of having to keep pushing the machine while standing up, I was able to process one copy per hour, which was done every few minutes, and I was able to hear compliments from my staff. After going through this, I thought that in order to innovate, it was necessary to constantly pay attention to and observe the field."""" As a freshman, I joined an on-campus classical music appreciation club and have been active until now. After working in the club for six years, I spent much of my college life hosting various club events such as the club's 40th anniversary events. As I spent a long time, there were many conflicts among club members. As one of the conflicts, there was a junior who particularly hated the chairman. I was dissatisfied with everything that had been set and walked away, and both the chairman and the club members were stressed out about it. I was close to my junior unlike everyone else, so I was asked what happened, and I was told that I felt betrayed by the chairman, who was close to my junior, who was asked to leave the club due to past incidents. I came to persuade my junior members by standing in the position of defending him so that he could get along well in the club, and whenever he said bad things to the chairman, I was able to resolve the conflict within the club by telling him."","""" In July 2014, I applied for an internship for the operation of the Youth Panel Survey and the Aging Research Panel, which was conducted from OO under the commission of OO, and worked for six months. As a statistics student, I was interested in surveys that collected statistics and wanted to learn about my future company life in advance. My job was to produce surveys and manage personal information of researchers and panels. However, I was not used to coding a programming language for surveys that I had never seen before, and I had a hard time with the volume of surveys being very large. As I wanted to complete my work successfully, I searched for applications and Internet documents and studied them. As the deadline approached, I worked overtime until midnight, and I finally completed the survey within the deadline and was able to complete it in December without any problems. After the project, I had dinner with various departments and felt proud that I had successfully completed the project.

In addition, I learned MSSQL and R programming by taking courses such as computer data processing and data analysis and design, and in particular, I got an A+ in the R programming class, which made me interested in statistical programming. During the internship period, I learned a new language by learning survey programming tools called Blaise and Confirm. In addition, I was able to experience company life and project execution by constantly communicating with other departments for the project. In the big data club that I joined after the internship, I learned R and Python programming for big data analysis. In addition, I was able to experience data analysis in real life through projects within the society. Since we were not participating in an external contest, we all had time to program after discussing the direction of the analysis with significance. The first project I did was predicting moviegoers. The box office api data provided by the Korea Film Council was downloaded and processed so that it could be analyzed through R or Python, and the number of spectators for three days was predicted by considering similar movies and the number of spectators by day of the week. The next project was a project to crawl posts on Naver's cafe bulletin board using Python. Our group crawled through posts from meetings of people who sent their boyfriends to the military, and analyzed which groups of couples did not break up until they were discharged. In addition, to find out the characteristics of separated couples, we analyzed the posts of separated parties and visualized the mainly used words. I want to be in charge of big data at SK C&C. In particular, I want to do something that is helpful to society by using public data.

"Making something for people. When I first learned about computers, I became interested in the relationship between S/W and the people who use them. Naturally, the interest developed into the idea of creating a web/mobile that makes people convenient. So, I planned and developed an app that helps me group up with friends and manage my schedule together based on the web and mobile. OONote was the beginning of my first project to create something for people. Starting with this, I carried out projects that were close to people, such as an intranet that easily stores and manages members' information, promotional sites that use dynamic effects to entertain users' eyes, and websites that support home sharing procedures. And now I am working on a number of projects that make people convenient, and I think about how to serve them beyond just simply serving them. I have been developing them so far, wondering whether users can get what they want with efficient movement and how to construct algorithms for pleasant performance. I took pride in making something for people and worked hard to make a better program, so I was able to grow to this day. I think this tendency coincides with Naver's direction of providing user-centered services. Now I want to continue my pride in Naver. [Javascript 4] It is not too difficult to implement the function.

We thought that the business logic would fluctuate due to the nature of the subject, so we designed it with a focus on future maintenance. So, we separated the responsibilities of classes by designing the business logic of home sharing as an interface with the Controller-Service-Store. In addition, DI using annotation was also actively used. As expected, the requirements between projects changed from moment to moment, and we were able to successfully carry out the project safely because we designed it for this. [NOSQL Web Dashboard - Javascript] Using NOSQL's Rest api, we implemented a web dashboard that fetches and visualizes the status values of DB. The goal is to implement a gauge bar that represents Ram's space, a chart that shows traffic in the past, and a component that can see live nodes at a glance. Although we received the existing JS source, it was minified and it seemed difficult for humans to analyze. So, rather than analyzing it with limited resources, we developed it in a way that we re-implemented it using an open source library related to visualization. Using a library, but parts that did not meet the requirements were modified after analyzing the library, so we created components of the dashboard one by one, and we were able to complete the project within the promised deadline.

"[There is no tree that cannot climb!] When faced with a really difficult task, I confronted them with the idea that there is no tree that cannot climb. It was time to work on a design project for a coffee vending machine in the logic circuit subject. We went beyond meeting the requirements and proceeded with this project with the goal of designing a vending machine like a commercial vending machine. At first, I looked at the internet and drawings to find out the algorithms and principles of how they operate. I applied that principle to design and program a gate circuit, but I was unable to proceed with this project due to an unknown error. So, leaving the project aside, after referring to related books and studying other instructions, I reviewed the design process and found that there was an error in adjusting the time of the input waveform on the test bench and corrected it. The idea of making a vending machine that can be put out on the market was an opportunity for me to try to develop more program skills that I lacked the idea of making a vending machine that could be put out on the market, and I was able to complete this project successfully.

[Always ready to help!] When someone else is in trouble within the IDIS team after joining the company, I am confident that I will always lead them by giving them help. It was time to take a test in dance sports, a liberal arts course. The paired Spanish Emma and Elena did not speak Korean, so they fell behind in class, so the professor looked for someone to help them. At that time, I offered to help. The two-member dance was organized through a situational play of a man who was conflicted between the two women, using a different situation than the three of them. I taught them the dance and steps I learned using all the methods I could, and I stayed in the practice room and practiced supplementary to get together with the two. And after the practice was over, we completed our teamwork by eating together. In the end, I got a perfect score in originality and compositional score on the last test. Through this experience, I had a chance to think more about the definition of helping others. However, if you help others with the full time and effort that you can spend, sometimes you can't concentrate and use all of them. I think this is because I didn't know how good I was at covering it and helped them first. In order to fix this, I try to reflect on myself and try to help before I can help. As I realize that there are many cases where it helps me in the end, I try to be more helpful in the way that I can. After joining IDIS, helping a team member in need is ultimately for the whole team, and furthermore, for the whole team, if there is a team member in need, I will step up and lead with the help."","""" Communicative Developer!"" My S/W Development and Big Data Technology are my strengths in performing the S/W development task of IDAS. To make up for the practical process of big data competency that my major knowledge is lacking, I took the Big Data Manager Course from the oo Association. I learned JAVA, Oracle, Hadoop, and R through the training. And based on this, I worked on four team projects with people from other majors, such as humanities, statistics, and others, rather than just a team between majors. As a result, I was able to work on projects such as Indigame Development, Police Station Management System, School Web Application, and Employment Personnel Management System. This gave me an opportunity to upgrade my S/W development capabilities. In addition, I participated in the 'DA Design Contest' and modeled the data on the human resources management system of a company. While conducting data modeling that meets the company's requirements, I was able to have practical experience of B2B, which is different from B2C. Through this S/W development experience and various experiences of B2B and B2C, I was interested in and applied for IDIS's S/W development job."" When choosing a company, I choose based on the following criteria. Is it a company that I can learn from? I want to join a company that makes me more curious about myself 5 or 10 years after I joined the company. It was when I was in the first grade when I was in the programming club. I developed my programming skills through information exchange with seniors who used basic education and public lecture time. At the end of the semester, I learned programming skills and achieved good grades in programming-related subjects. While working as a club, I experienced myself growing up along with my programming skills. Also, I thought it would be the icing on the cake if I could work in an active attitude with interest. By contributing to IDIS by developing through learning, I would like to promote growth together and become a member of IDIS that I am curious to see in 5 years and 10 years from now. I will tackle the task with passion and finish it with my own hands. I remember the moments when I participated in the Campus Patent Strategy Universiade and tried to overcome and challenge myself passionately for 3 months. In order to solve the problem, based on the understanding of technology, patents, and intellectual property rights, the technology and patents were analyzed and the possibility of infringement, invalidation, and avoidance design were presented through the analysis. First, the main components of the patent were analyzed to understand the patent in question and the technology in question. However, there was a limit to understanding the technology at the company level. So I searched for basic books related to technology and studied them deeply, and tried to understand the technology by reading explanations on the background technology in hundreds of papers. Then, I found related patents and papers based on the technology analysis. Of the thousands of patents obtained by searching the key components of the patent with keywords, we found a total of five key prior art documents related to this patent.Since the patent in question was a U.S. patent, as a result of persistent review of the data sheets of the products related to this patent by the leading communication equipment companies in the U.S., we found that this patent could be invalidated by oo's products. In addition, judging that there is a possibility of invalidation of this patent through prior art literature, a solution called avoidance design was proposed to compose the design by changing the core parts that may infringe on this patent in a different way. Through the analysis, we found a product related to the possibility of invalidation of this patent and also found the possibility of patent infringement by other prior literature. There were many difficulties in the process of solving the problem, but we analyzed the problem with the idea of 'be an expert in this patent more than anyone else'. As a result, we were able to get good results. I will take the responsibility and passion for the work gained through this experience to work in the S/W development department of IDIS."", ""???, I will take on the task of the S/W development department of IDIS."""
"[Leap of Signage Business] When I was in college, I developed interest in the signage business by working on my graduation work 'Project to Improve Subway Kiosk'. In order to increase the interest in using the kiosk that was inadvertently left unattended in the subway, we announced a plan to activate the kiosk by combining Kinect's motion recognition technology. We controlled the kiosk through hand gesture recognition and promoted the recommendation menu by category to promote the local community, increasing the interest of users. Although we did not win the prize at the graduation exhibition, we were evaluated as a positive system that will activate the kiosk of the subway. The interest in the signage business was raised by cultivating and cultivating basic knowledge about Java, JSP, HTml, and DB during the JAVA curriculum, which completed in August, we prepared for the future by honing our development skills to create a link between the web and objects. In May, Samsung Electronics announced a signage system that usually uses it as a general mirror through its 'mirror display' and provides various information on beauty and hair care if necessary. It led communication with users, not simply delivering information. I believe that the signage market is such a growing field that all existing walls of the world are called potential markets.

When I was in sixth grade, I participated in the Incheon Science Box Assembly as an autonomous theme, and completed the space station I imagined and received the bronze medal within the limited time. Although I was young, I applied the principle of power using provided parts and motors based on creative ideas, and I was able to achieve good results by demonstrating my dexterity and concentration. The sense of accomplishment that I felt at that time gave me a good opportunity to decide to major in the future in engineering. After entering college, I learned the importance of ideas to change our lives conveniently and effectively in the creative engineering design class. I had a class that presented ways to improve uncomfortable systems in school in IT. Through brainstorming, we came up with various ideas, and among them, we decided to improve the problems of the school's academic system. Because there was only one academic discipline on campus, students were always crowded and there was a long line outside the restaurant to buy meal tickets. In order to solve the problem of the delay in mealtime, we proposed a change to a system that allows students to pay directly with a card as a vehicle passes through the toll booth in a high-pass manner, and we calculated the expected system structure, development period, and development cost and presented it in the class. The professor praised it as a good system to improve the problems of learning. Currently, the school's academic discipline has been changed to a system that allows payment by card like high-pass, providing convenience in school life. Bamboo will not sprout in the first year if it is buried in the ground and fertilized, and then it will finally sprout in the fifth year and grow by 20m in about 90 days. The engineering interest I have developed since childhood has been filled with knowledge through IT-related activities through computer engineering major selection, and in the fourth year, I have demonstrated my skills through the subway kiosk project using my graduation work Kinect.

""[Pocketball Go's potential for augmented reality development] Recently, the most popular game in the global game community is Niantic's Pokmon GO. It is an augmented reality smartphone game created using location-based services that swept through the App Store and Google Play Store in 24 hours when it was released in North America on July 6. People flocked to New York's Central Park to catch rare Pokmon, and the fact that it will become a Pokmon GO in only some areas such as Sokcho in Korea sparked the Sokcho tourism craze. I, too, headed to Sokcho to catch Pokmon and enjoyed the game passionately, collecting a total of 43 kinds of 160 monsters for two days and one night. Many companies rushed into the augmented reality market to the extent that it was said that they needed to develop a Korean version of Pokmon GO, but about two months later, as the popularity of Pokmon GO cooled, the number of users and sales dropped sharply compared to the installation of the app, and problems were raised. First of all, it was difficult to communicate smoothly with users due to the problem of bugs due to the system that has not yet been stabilized compared to the high interest, and we were busy reflecting on successful cases that we did not have before without properly analyzing the cause. With augmented reality technology in full swing, I think the biggest challenge for us is how to lead the long-term driving force rather than ending the initial market frenzy in a single shot. In addition, it will be important to pay attention to new technologies that have great potential for future development first and take an active attitude to lead the market change. Samsung SDS introduced Cello VWS, a warehouse management system using virtual reality, in March, and supplemented the limitations of the logistics site through remote monitoring using VR outside the warehouse. In the future, augmented reality will complement the problems of the real world and provide convenience to users, and will be useful in the home, medical, and defense industries. We need to break away from the passive attitude of our society and actively take the lead in the future market."",,,,"
"[Columbus Ho, Coupang of E-commerce] Coupang has shown the world a variety of innovative services that are not a waste of the name 'Korea's E-commerce leader'. By running Coupang Man, its own delivery manpower, and realizing 'rocket delivery' aimed at same-day delivery rather than just delivery, we have established a 'direct commerce model' that provides direct services from product sales to delivery for the first time in the world. In addition, for the first time in the industry, we have built and operated a 'safe number service' that protects personal information through virtual phone numbers instead of customers' actual phone numbers. Through this, the statistics show that 50% of the people use the Coupang app and the number of mobile app users in the same industry for four consecutive years, confirming that Coupang has become the number one mobile app users for users. I think I look a lot like Coupang in that I lead innovation through 'first'. A year ago, I had the experience of starting a fashion shopping mall with a rather unconventional operation method called 'pre-check-and-check payment', which is differentiated from the existing shopping mall's 'pre-payment and confirmation' operation method. By improving the cumbersome refund and return process of consumers through the 'pre-check and payment' operation method, we tried to provide customers with trust and convenience. In addition, we tried to be competitive with existing shopping malls through the concept of providing personalized styling services, and targeted niche markets by targeting men rather than women as our main customer base. This naturally led to the realization of the 'first male-customized O2O styling service' in the shopping mall industry, and returns and refunds were made at an average rate of 4% lower than competitors. This experience in starting a business made me dream as a system architecture expert in the e-commerce field, realizing unique ideas into innovative services. In order to realize my dream, I applied to Coupang, which is best realizing innovative services through 'first'. I will become a sailor of the Columbus ferry Coupang, and I will discover and pioneer a new continent in the field of e-commerce that has not yet been discovered."" [Develop is My Life] Since childhood, I used to draw pictures of future undersea cities, food, and fashion that others could not have imagined. People around me were surprised by my paintings and praised me for having unique ideas. I became interested in programming that allowed me to express my unique ideas freely like on a canvas, and naturally moved on to the Department of Computer Science. I continued my interest in programming not only through my major learning but also through the activities of the app development club. When I was a senior in college, I became greedy to develop a service through programming and set a goal of surprising the world by realizing my unique idea into a real service. In order to develop a real service, I felt that my major knowledge alone was not enough, so I stepped out of the well of the school and entered T Academy, an educational institution for development experts. By completing two courses by experts in Android and mobile servers at T Academy, I have built enough service development capabilities to implement the service in real life. With these development capabilities and my own unique ideas, I founded a fashion shopping mall called 'OO' a year ago as the first step to surprise the world. I led the team by directly leading the team toward the goal of creating the 'first men's personal styling service' by bringing together college students from various majors such as business, fashion, and design. As a service developer, I had a lot of conversations with planners about service function processes and with designers about service UX/UI to understand the broad range of services and improve the composition of service screens efficiently. In addition, I tried to communicate a lot with stylists who face customers directly through styling, and through this, I tried to improve the service quality by identifying processes that are not actually needed and processes that need to be added in the service. Based on these efforts, I was honored to be selected as SK Planet's nurturing start-up, but due to various business deteriorations, I finally decided to close the business. Although it was the first failure in society, the two things I could get from starting a business are the passion to become an expert and build development capabilities, and the ability to communicate with team members regardless of job to create better services. The reason I want to become an S/W developer is that I feel that the moment of development is the most valuable moment for me. In addition, the process of uniting for one goal with diverse people felt the most enjoyable to me. The easiest and best way to express my unique ideas, which is quirky but unique, is programming, and I will continue to build up my competence as a developer without stopping to value myself."",""1) Smart Meter Project / OOO / 2016.05 ~ 2016.06 - Project Introduction: It is a project to develop a Firmware Solution for smart meters that collects electricity usage data from each home and sends it to electric companies by loading it on LTE signals. - Development Environment: [Linux / Ubuntu 14.01], [C, Shell / Eclipse CDT], [SVN / GCT SVN Source Storage] - In charge Development: Implementation of Multi Client Socket Server ??? We developed a socket server that receives the power data measured by the application through socket communication with the Multi Client Socket Server client. It was developed with a Multi Client Connection structure because it has a structure where multiple clients send packets at the same time. It was also implemented in a TCP socket structure for packet transmission reliability. While implementing the function, if more than one client transmits packets at the same time, a file descriptor error occurred that the server could not receive in order.As a result of analyzing the problem, it was because the server handled the process of accepting the client's socket connection request in a blocking manner. At the same time, the problem could be solved by modifying the blocking structure to a non-blocking structure so that the server can receive packets sent by multiple clients asynchronously. Through this project, we were able to accurately understand the principle and structure of socket communication and the difference between synchronous/asynchronous communication. 2) Smartfren MIFI Andromax M2Y Firmware Development / OOO / 2016.01~2016.04 - Project Introduction: It is a project to develop Firmware of 'Andromax M2Y', a pocket WiFi of Smartfren, one of the Indonesian telecommunications companies. The device is a portable router that enables data to be used using 4G LTE signals using Pocket WiFi. - Development Environment: [Linux/Ubuntu 14.01], [C, Shell, javascript/Eclipse CDT], [SVN/GCT SVN Source Storage] - Responsible Development: Marvell WiFi Application Control Daemon Development, Network Advanced Settings Function Implementation, WiFi Disk Implementation ??? Marvell WiFi Application Control Daemon Development CPE Web Page that allows users to change WiFi setting information through Host IP. The client was configured using HTML, JavaScript, and Jquery, and the web interface was implemented with Cgi. We developed the Linux Daemon program to control WiFi applications and set WiFi configuration information through this Web Page. ??? Network Advanced Settings Implementation A number of filtering functions have been implemented for indiscriminate intrusion and restrictions from external networks, such as barriers. MAC Filtering that allows/blocks access to specific MAC addresses, IP Filtering that controls access to specific external IPs, URL Filtering that blocks access to URLs with specific strings, and Port Filtering that blocks access to specific ports. In addition to the filtering function, we also implemented a Port Forwarding function that allows external access only to specific ports and forwards to specific internal IPs. The above functions were implemented as Linux applications to run Linux Kernel and were developed using C. In addition, Trigger was developed as Shell Script so that the application runs Linux Kernel. ??? WiFi Disk An WiFi disk that can use the File Storage function is implemented through a WiFi signal on that device. The UI was developed through CPE Web Page. Cgi and WiFi disk applications were implemented using C, and the File System Command for Linux was configured to be set through Shell Script. WiFi disk functions include File Upload, Download, Delete, Renaming, and Create Directory. In addition, a preview function was implemented to allow media files such as Image/Text/Audio/Movie to be previewed on the Web UI. During the implementation of this function, there was a problem that buffer memory overflow occurred when the file size attached to the Web Page was more than 1GB. The cause of the problem is that when files are transferred from the Client, they are divided by 256 bytes and then written to the memory at certain intervals after being accumulated in a temporary buffer on Linux, which was caused by Linux not being able to write to memory as quickly as the size of the transferred buffer. To solve this problem, the size of the transfer buffer for Lighttpd, which was used as a web application at the time, was modified from 256 bytes to 128 bytes. Since then, the problem has not occurred even if a 4GB file is sent. 3) OO Mobile App Development / OO / 2015.01 ~ 2015.07 - Service Introduction: It is a project to develop an O2O service for men's personal styling subscriptions. - Development Environment: [Java(Android), Node.js/Eclipse], [MySQL / MySQL WorkBench], [SVN / Subclipse] - Responsible Development: Complete Client Development, Middleware Server Development, DB Design and Construction ??? Network Manager module for Layout implementation according to Client Side UX design and communication with the server was developed through Android. In addition, we developed the data parsing structure of the public data Open API for delivery status and road name address information. In addition, it was linked with PG's payment system for payment. We developed Restful API service middleware server using ??? Server Side Node.js. For scalability and flexibility in service system management, Restful API definition and Json definition were documented. In addition, we built Server Hosting using Amazon AWS EC2. ??? DB member table and product table were organized into many-to-many relationships to efficiently manage information on purchase history. In addition, a one-to-many relationship was defined so that one stylist could be assigned to each member so that the information of the customer he/she manages can be checked at once on an app dedicated to the stylist. In addition, for the accuracy and reliability of payment for product purchases, we built a database through InnoDB's MySQL considering transition-safe. In addition, using Amazon AWS RDS, we used DB Server Hos"
"My major was mostly related to Java, JSP, and the web. I have experience in creating shopping mall sites using this. I believe that developers should always have an attitude to study. So, after graduating from college, I have completed an education on oracle db in external education, and also have experience in completing an education called vulnerability analysis through mock hacking. Based on various education and experience, I am ready to work at Hancom, and I plan to continue studying after joining the company. My strength is being creative. In the past, when I took a quiz to citizens and gave gifts to the correct answers. However, my participation rate was low, and I came up with an idea to successfully end the activity. Instead of giving a gift when I got the quiz right, I made some changes by giving it to the citizens first. Then, the citizens who received the gift did not turn away from us. We filled out all the number of people we wanted in just one hour. To achieve results, I have experience of enhancing efficiency by using creative ideas."" ""I had volunteer work while teaching children at Seongmin Social Welfare Center or Yeonmu Center during the 2013/14 vacation. The reason I started volunteering was that I left elementary school in the countryside when I was young, and I lacked a way to contact better learning. So I thought of volunteering to children who are in a difficult situation at home after entering university. So I came to provide after-school learning guidance to children at a social welfare center where many children in need come. I enjoyed the time to meet with children while volunteering, and I was even more happy if they understood the concept properly. Just as I was rewarded by helping children in need, I will work at Hancom and dream about the future of my life by helping customers, colleagues, and the company."",,,,"
"[Challenging to start a business to create something out of nothing!] Since I was young, I used to draw pictures of future undersea cities, food, fashion, etc. that others could not have imagined. When I saw my paintings, people around me were surprised and praised me for having unique ideas. I became interested in programming, which allowed me to express my unique ideas freely as if I were drawing on a canvas, and naturally I went on to major in computer science. I continued my interest in programming not only through my major learning but also through my activities as an app development club. By the time I was in my fourth year of college, I had a desire to develop a service through programming, and I set a goal of surprising the world by realizing my own unique idea into a real service. In order to develop a real service, I felt that my major knowledge alone was not enough, and I kicked out of the well called the school and entered T Academy, an educational institution for development professionals. By completing two courses by experts in Android and mobile servers at T Academy, I was able to develop enough services to actually implement them. As the first step toward surprising the world with unique ideas, I started a fashion shopping mall called 'OO' a year ago. We wanted to provide customers' trust and convenience through the operation method called 'Preliminary Payment After Payment', which is differentiated from the existing shopping mall called 'Preliminary Payment After Confirmation'. In addition, we tried to make it competitive with existing shopping malls through the concept of providing personalized styling services, and targeted niche markets by targeting men rather than women. This naturally led to the realization of individualized O2O styling services for men for the first time in the shopping mall industry, and returns and refunds were made at an average rate of 4% lower than competitors. Based on these results, we were able to get an opportunity to be selected as a nurturing start-up for SK Planet. [Lack of flexibility] However, despite these achievements, we had an unexpected difficulty while developing the service due to the disadvantage of trying to solve any problem by ourselves. During the implementation of the payment system, the PHP-based code samples and manuals provided by payment PG were very different from the server platform Node.js, which I implemented, which made it difficult to implement. I tried to solve the problem through PHP programming books and Internet search, but I wasted five days. I eventually asked the payment PG for help through phone or e-mail, and when I found out that it was a problem that could be solved simply in a day, I felt a great letdown. When a problem arises through this opportunity, I try to solve the problem quickly by approaching anyone first, asking them, and learning. [Responsibility as much as a professional] Although there were many difficulties during service development due to these shortcomings, the responsibility of being 'the owner of the service is me' was the driving force that led to the commercialization of shopping mall services. It was not easy to develop the Front/Back-End of the service by myself because I was the only developer in a start-up team composed of various majors. However, this start-up started with my idea, and I devoted myself to the development, staying all night in the office for three months with a sense of responsibility that no one else could take charge of it. After these efforts, I was able to develop the service within the target period and successfully commercialize the service. The 'challenge' to surprise the world with my unique ideas, the 'pioneering spirit' that created the first men's personalized styling service for shopping malls, the 'patience' and 'responsibility' that I should not finish what I started, and the 'development capability as professionals' that developed the entire system front/back-end through the start-up of shopping malls. I will exert my utmost efforts to help Hana I&S be at the center of innovation in the Hana Financial Group by utilizing these five capabilities. ""I have worked as an intern for the last nine months at a company focused on producing LTE modem chips and developing solutions. During my internship, I participated in the firmware development project for the smart meter, one of the core technologies of smart grid. A smart meter is a digital electronic meter that transmits power usage data measured in real time in each home to an electric company through LTE signals. My role in this project was to implement a socket server that receives the power consumption data measured through the client application through socket communication. I was nervous because it was a relatively big task, but I made up my mind with the responsibility that I would implement it perfectly because my team members trusted me. Not long after I started developing the function I was in charge of, I encountered difficulties. When the socket server was initially implemented, in the process of accepting the client's connection request, the socket was created in a blocking structure. Because of this, if more than one client transmits packets at the same time, the server first receives only the packets from the client that created the socket and does not receive the packets from the rest of the clients. To solve this problem alone, the server tried to communicate with each client through Multi Thread when creating a socket with the client, but it showed not only rapid performance degradation but also unstable system behavior. Eventually, I couldn't solve it by myself and wasted three days. After suffering alone, I decided that it would have a big impact on the project deadline, so I explained the cause of the problem and what needed to be resolved to a senior developer in the team and asked for advice. By changing the part treated as a blocking structure to a Non-Blocking structure, I was advised by the senior developer to implement it as an asynchronous socket server, and the server code was modified. First, the blocking socket was changed to a non-blocking socket through the fcntl function. After that, the file descriptor (FD) change was detected through the select function before the recv function receiving packets from the client was called.This allows servers to receive packets from all clients simultaneously, even if a particular client's packet transfer is not complete or there is no data to send. The project gave us an accurate understanding of the structure and principles of socket communication, and by developing synchronous/asynchronous sockets ourselves, we have the ability to design and implement contextual socket structures. In addition, by developing socket servers ourselves, we have created a variety of development capabilities, including the ability to implement Linux applications, compiling in Linux environments, and managing source revision through SVN within team projects. I will use my full capabilities to become an IT employee with diverse and solid technology so that Hana I&S can become a leading smart finance player."",,,,"
"[Independence that provided an expensive experience!] I have always been independent since I was a child. That's why I always tried to do what I could do on my own, and I didn't rely on my parents as much as possible. Before entering college, I wanted to make up for my lack of study through an academy, but most of all, I didn't want to burden my parents with the financial burden, so I had to think about it a lot. As a result, after collecting a lot of information, I came to understand that there is a system that allows me to take classes for free while working at a college academy, and after an interview, I was able to work as a work scholarship. Looking back, the working life I did at large academies was the first step in society. Classes that require as many as 100 students and as many as 300 students were divided into roles, and before the class started, 20 students worked together to clean up, such as chalking for lectures and checking the status of microphones. Particularly during the vacation period, many lectures were held, and more students than students usually came to take famous lectures. Due to the large number of lectures held, there was a situation where several classrooms that had to be prepared overlapped. However, the scholarship students took the time to help each other, not only to do what they were assigned to do, but also to solve the shortage of manpower. While working as a student at a college for nearly a year, I was able to have valuable experience to learn the ability to organize, to be responsible, and to work together. Even after entering college, I worked part-time and made some pocket money by myself and solved financial problems by myself. I am confident that the valuable experience and independence learned through the process of growth can strengthen the bond between students and create synergies, thereby enhancing the efficiency and contributing to the work.""[Responsibility! Leads everyone as representative of the department] After entering college, I became the representative when I was in the first year of the department. While playing a public role, I personally wanted to help my classmates. While listening to the class, I learned that classmates who entered the required liberal arts course called ""college mathematics"" from liberal arts in high school are having difficulty keeping up with the class. After thinking about how to help these students, I came to find a solution. We started to post the solutions on the cafe by solving the materials and problems that have been organized every week, and we posted and shared the organized materials so that friends in need can refer to it continuously. It was not easy because it was not a one-time event, but we exchanged information through the cafe without fail with a sense of responsibility. In addition, as other students who were good at math participated later on, they studied without giving up on ""college math"" and all of them in the same grade were able to get good results. As a developer, I have been properly utilizing the semester and the vacation period to build up my competence. First, we prepared for the competition held at the university under the theme of ""Web Service for Club Introduction and Support"" in groups of two during the semester. The server was developed with the MVC structure jsp (model 2). Since I had never learned JSP and there was a fixed period for submitting the results, I stayed until late at night during the period of planning the service to participate in the competition and studied the shortcomings by reading the Internet and books. I proceeded with the project with tension because I had to complete and present during the three-month period while studying with two people. At this time, I was able to understand the concept of MVC structure and develop my ability to use Internet search. In addition, I was able to experience how the programming called Java, which I learned in school, was applied and used in the project. As a result of concentrating, I fell in love with it so passionately that the period seemed short, and I even received an unexpected award. And the sense of accomplishment came to me as a value more than effort. Second, during the vacation, I have intensively built up my competencies by doing external activities, free from the burden of classes and exams. While working on a project through an external club, I participated in the hackathon, which lasted for 2 nights and 3 days, and as a team, developers, designers, and planners teamed up to plan, complete the project, and demonstrate a service to share information on street performances. It was a valuable experience to realize that while creating a service in a short time, it is important to quickly implement it through your own technology, but it was also important to share roles that could achieve optimal efficiency and teamwork that helped each other as well as play their own roles. I'm sure that the consistently cultivated ability will quickly adapt as a family to ""entering school"" and become a person who will be able to become one and help others while performing his or her duties."",""""[Problem-solving ability through consideration and collaboration] I think that the basic skills that a developer must have are consideration and collaboration among team members. While working outside the company, I worked on a web project with majors from other universities. During the project, one of my team members suddenly left, causing a crisis, and everyone was confused. I thought that if left without resolving this situation quickly, the atmosphere of the team and the progress of the project would be loosened, and I suggested that I would do the role of the person who stepped forward. Everyone agreed with the opinion, and the other team members also showed positive attitude that they would do more than they were in charge of, and the atmosphere within the team quickly found vitality. There were some difficult parts due to the sudden increase in the number of parts to be done in the middle of the project, but we developed them together while maintaining tension, and we were able to safely complete the ""Men's Care Product Recommendation Service"" within a set schedule and show it at the demonstration. At this point, I learned that no matter what difficulties we face, we can overcome them by finding a solution together, and that team projects are important for individual abilities, but also for collaboration among team members."",,"
"[Developer looking for things he doesn't know until it is resolved] My strength is curiosity and problem solving ability. I am interested in technologies and trends that I use often in practice, so I talked about them with a friend who works in IT. One time, I heard a bug-related technology called log4j on the way home together. It is a technology that I use for sure in practice, but it was unfamiliar and I was curious about it at the time. I couldn't fall asleep because I was curious when I got home, so I turned on my laptop and looked for a well-organized site about log4j through the Internet, and the questions were solved, but as my questions were resolved, I wanted to apply them to my personal projects. While searching the Internet for information necessary to apply it and applying it to personal projects, I learned the trend of using it as a secured logback in recent log4j, and I applied it as a logback that day, organized it on my personal blog, and fell asleep. My passion and curiosity to ask and look for such questions until they are resolved is my differentiated strength. It came out for a while while talking, but if there is a problem while developing the web in Dana through the efforts and curiosity of finding it with interest, solving questions, and applying it to individual projects, I will contribute to the development of Dana and actively participate in the work through such capabilities. ""As a [challenging developer], I voluntarily participated in the development club and carried out the project during the vacation to build up my competence as a developer. During the semester, I tried to communicate through various experiences while challenging myself for a software competition. Among them, I was able to develop my skills through the competition and hackathon. During the semester, I prepared for the competition held at the university under the theme of ""Web Service for Introduction and Support of Clubs"" in pairs. The server was developed with the MVC structure jsp (model 2). Since I had never learned JSP and there was a fixed period of time to submit results, I stayed until late at night during the period when I was planning the service to participate in the competition and studied the shortcomings by reading the Internet and books.

In addition, I participated in a hackathon for two nights and three days, and developed a web service that shared information about street performances with developers, designers, and planners through PHP, I developed my ability to quickly apply the language I studied. Through the capabilities that I have prepared like this, I am confident that I can quickly adapt to work and contribute to web development in Dana."",""""[Vacation-Development Group is a partnership!] Vacation created the greatest communication time to build capacity through the joint development club. Based on these times, I am currently working for ""Nextors,"" a web and app development club. There are two reasons why I became active in the ""Nexters"" club steadily. The first is that I can collaborate with designers that I did not have in school. Unlike the projects carried out by developers, I was able to broaden the range of perspectives and thoughts that I develop from the perspective of users by having a meeting with a designer who approaches UI. The second is that I have the opportunity to work with a developer who is an office worker who works in practice, not with a project between college student developers. While working on the project together, I was able to get an opportunity to learn new skills such as RSS parsing, and the completion of the project was high. While working, I worked on two projects, ""Taxi rides application"", acting as an app server by using a web service that allows you to view materials on the subject of interest through node.js."", [Voluntary challenge! Personal project!] I was interested in using RSS a lot around me, so I have done a personal project using RSS. While working on the project, there was a problem that I had no experience with spring and that RSS was unfamiliar. In the case of spring, since it was my first time, I thought it would be good to receive reference materials and proceed with it, so I asked the professor to study the materials that seniors had conducted in class. While looking at the references, I set the overall framework, and I added functions to the framework by applying content that is not in the references, such as sending emails through gmail, through Internet search. During the project, I solved the obstruction by looking at the answers and materials left on the community sites from the Internet search. However, in the case of RSS, it took a lot of time because it was completely unfamiliar. I also searched for RSS through search and asked my acquaintances while doing external activities, but I couldn't get the answer I wanted because it was unfamiliar. However, I really wanted to solve the questions, so I kept searching and looked it up and found that fetching information through RSS was a kind of parsing. After learning that it was a kind of parsing, I searched for materials centered on the keyword parsing and found out that there are many libraries for parsing. We found a library suitable for the java environment, selected and decided to use one called Jsoup, and tested it. In the end, we succeeded in using the Jsoup library to get the information we wanted through RSS and use it in the format we wanted. After importing and processing the information, I used it from the user's point of view, and I thought it was uncomfortable to see, click, and go to the article page.So, I thought it would be effective to implement a paragraph summary algorithm and apply it to the contents of the article so that the core contents of the article can be understood only by the summarized contents. I decided to implement a paragraph summary algorithm, and I thought about the logic of the algorithm while searching on the Internet under the keyword paragraph summary. In the end, the logic of the paragraph summary was implemented so that the key paragraphs could be found by checking the frequency of the words in the article and prioritizing the paragraphs with the words with the highest frequency. Although there were several crises like this, I was able to get the desired results by solving them one by one. While working on this project, I could feel that passion and testing from the user's point of view are also important. I was able to see the earnestness and importance of the project because I was passionate about the part that I was unfamiliar with the technology called spring and RSS, but I looked for and asked until it was resolved. When I thought about the part I did not know at the time of development from the user's point of view, I was able to find the complement point of paragraph summary, and I could feel that it was important to consider both the user's position while developing. This project is the result of these two things. As such, I will keep in mind what I felt this time and not forget it."
"I think there is a great potential for the development of financial it. Recently, the domestic financial industry has eased a lot of regulations on it, but it is being incorporated in various ways. So I thought that the job of financial it has a great potential for development and that I will be able to expand my capabilities. The new future of financial it, which is the vision of Lotte Capital, is like a dream that I want to achieve in my job. Lotte Capital's goal is to develop new and diverse financial products using information and communication technology to meet the diverse needs of consumers, thereby enhancing the benefits of society as a whole, and I applied to Lotte Capital because I thought it would be great if I could demonstrate my capabilities and support them. I will try to exert a higher synergy effect by adding Lotte Capital's capabilities, such as segmented financial products and leased products, and my capabilities in business administration/it. I am a person who is responsible for the results. My father worked abroad for about 10 years from my elementary school to high school. My father worked for a construction company and worked in the Middle East. After entering high school, I began to study far away. Then, while I was video chatting with my father during my second year of high school summer vacation, he said, ""I believe in you. I was able to work with my family because I believed in you. He said, ""Don't trust me in the future."" I shed tears. Since then, I have decided to change and actually acted. I thought I should take responsibility for what I am doing. However, I lacked the basics and I spent a year in re-employment after my third year of high school. There is something I gained by successfully spending that year. It is self-control. I studied according to the set rules every day for a year. It was very difficult to study a set time and a set amount every day. But I thought it was a promise to myself and I studied hard for a year. So I think I gained high self-control through re-employment. I have developed a strong mental strength to overcome long project tasks or intense tasks in my job at Lotte Capital it."" [When you think about them from a customer's point of view, the answer is visible] I have experience in solving problems within a group by thinking about them from a customer's point of view. In the first semester of my third year of college, I participated in a group of supporters run by the Korea Copyright Commission. During the group's activities, our team wrote a quiz about promotions on a panel that we produced ourselves. Our plan was to give out self-made gifts only to citizens who took the quiz. However, the planned day was humid and hot, so the citizens were not interested in us. So I told my team members that I needed to change my plan. My plan was not to give them a gift if they got the quiz right, but to give them a gift first and give them a quiz. However, one of the team members objected, saying that if that happens, they will not receive a quiz confirmation and only the gift will be wasted. My team member was right, too. There was a high possibility that only gifts would be wasted. However, I expected that citizens would not easily walk away if they received the gift first. So to persuade my team members, I held the panel by myself and said I would do the mission for 30 minutes. Then, the team members who opposed said they would approve if the performance was higher. I proceeded the mission in the way I thought, and the result was twice as good as the previous method. Then, the team members who opposed agreed with me and completed the mission together. It was my experience to identify the problem, find the cause, and find a solution accordingly. In the case of it job, reading ability and the ability to find the problem quickly are important. I will use the analysis power gained from this experience to help Lotte Capital."""", and ""As a graduate of the Department of Management Information, I have gained knowledge in business administration, SQL, and JAVA. In particular, SQL performed the task of constructing a report card system using MSSQL and acquired theoretical and practical skills by listening to both DB introduction and management theory. Another major, Business Process Management Theory and System Analysis and Design, helps design a logical process flow in the process of development. In February 2016, I studied DB architecture by completing the Oracle Database: 11g Introduction to SQL/Workshop I / II curriculum for a total of 120 hours. I have learned about memories related to the methods to consider in order to create an efficient SQL statement. Currently, I am preparing an information security technician, and at the same time, I am gaining knowledge about security by taking a three-month curriculum called 'Diagnosis of Vulnerabilities through simulated hacking'. I have the advantage of being able to understand the other person's intentions well. When I was a scout intern, I was asked to do short research in a short time. Although I didn't have enough time, I set my own standards and researched them according to my priorities. Through this experience, I will find and deal with tasks with a high priority among many tasks first. On the other hand, my weakness is the lack of efficient time distribution for many tasks. I learned this at university, and after that, I put a time limit on one task. So, when there is a set time, I perform other tasks to prevent myself from being overly immersed in one task. These efforts have resulted in fewer mistakes even when I have to deal with tasks at the same time."" First of all, at the beginning of the job, I will focus on obtaining the information security technician certificate that I am currently preparing, and then figure out the tasks and think about how I can melt what I learned in the department class and external education into my tasks. In dealing with future tasks, I will not only study programming languages but also create experiences in the business together. Due to the nature of financial it, it is difficult to pursue efficiency if you don't know how other departments' tasks are handled. In addition, we will actively engage in exchanges with other teams in the it sector, where there are even four it teams, to promote the unity of the it team and to enable higher work efficiency and information sharing due to the synergy effect.The it job always has to think about optimal efficiency and how to reduce cost and time in the process. I think that in order to do this, the it team has to have more information about other departments and also share more information among it teams."",,,,"
"Samsung SDS is the most notable company in the domestic ICT industry with its own development solutions. It introduced the concept of fourth-party logistics and provides a single global logistics service. As such, Samsung SDS is exceeding the limits of ICT companies with the spirit of leading Samsung. In addition, as an ICT service company, it is contributing a lot to society to solve the emerging information gap problem. I really want to get an opportunity to work for Samsung SDS, which goes beyond the limits of the ICT industry and at the same time returns value to society. I am also studying CCNA/CCNP, a network expert course, from July this year to overcome my limitations. It is because I thought that just as engineers need humanities knowledge, humanities need practical knowledge. In particular, as I prepared for employment, my interest in IT technology, which was most closely related to my real life, grew. As I study networks, I am learning that the technologies used in real life are composed of various algorithms. In addition, I am learning how to solve problems in a troubleshooting manner, not a humanities problem-solving method. With my network knowledge and SCSA, I want to become a security expert. It is predicted that the use of IT security will become even more important in the Internet of Things (IOE) era. As a security expert, I want to create a standardized management system like the cello of Samsung SDS. Through this, I will not only generate revenue but also make sure that the world's IT technologies are used safely."" ""I loved answering and presenting in class. Discussions with various friends were also fun. In order to improve my presentation and discussion, I became interested in logic. In order to develop my logic, I took the course of Formal Logic. In addition, I learned a book called ""Local Thinking"" with the recommendation of my professor in order to develop logic that can be used in practice. After that, I am interested in solving logical problems and read related books. In order to participate in solution development, logic is essential. In the process of collaborating on solution development, I need logic to support my opinion. Also, logic finds the root causes of various problems and helps solve problems. I will be a member of Samsung SDS that presents opinions and solves problems based on this logic. It was when I was studying after entering college. I wondered if I was a person with good personality. I wondered if I was ready to go out into society and communicate with others without prejudice. I started a bath service for the disabled by joining the disabled bath service club Happy Bubble. Bath service for the disabled was not an easy task. It was also traumatizing to see a disabled person naked for the first time. It was very difficult physically to bathe a disabled person who could not move. While volunteering for the disabled for more than a year, I talked with them a lot. I felt that I was a person who had the same concerns as me, such as family, romance, and work. I was able to talk with them, sympathize with them, and make friends with the disabled. Through the bath service for the disabled, I was able to feel the joy of sacrificing and giving to myself. In addition, I felt the importance of giving away prejudice and sincerely communicating as if I were naked through volunteer activities. I would like to share my heart and communicate with various stakeholders including team members at Samsung SDS. In addition, through communication with customers, I will become an employee who provides the services that customers really want at Samsung SDS. The field in which my major, the humanities, is most in the spotlight is ironically in the IT field. And it was world-leading IT companies such as Google and Facebook that started to emphasize the humanities. Google and Facebook have something in common. These companies have abandoned their stereotypes from the perspective of developers. They have created an environment where users can use them more conveniently from their perspective. This change of perspective enabled them to survive the fierce competition. And at the center was the humanities perspective. In this respect, I think the convergence of IT technology and the humanities is very important. The areas that Samsung SDS is investing in as future growth engines have in common is convergence. ""I want to develop a service that takes advantage of the values of convergence at Samsung SDS."" ""In the global shipbuilding industry, Japan regained the top spot in monthly orders in January 2015 for the first time in six years and eight months. In February 2016, Samsung Heavy Industries ranked third in the world in terms of backlog of orders, giving Imabari Shipbuilding another third. The shipbuilding industry is considered one of the most important industries in the Korean economy because there are many projects linked to the front and rear and it has a significant impact on the local economy. The Japanese shipbuilding business, which had a global market share of less than 10%, was able to regain its global ranking because it continuously invested in new technologies and improved productivity through two major restructuring to cope with the recession after the oil shock in the 1970s. In the case of Imabari Shipyard, it established a shipyard specializing in LNG and worked hard to develop technologies such as developing eco-friendly ships. At the same time, the Japanese government encouraged restructuring, such as providing up to 80% of the ship price of the merged company at an interest rate of just 1%, and provided funding in consideration of the characteristics of the shipbuilding industry, which can easily fall into a liquidity crisis due to its low capital turnover. In Korea, STX, formerly ranked fourth in the world in shipbuilding, is also reducing 800 people through legal management and securing stable profits through business restructuring and streamlining orders. Judging from the cases of STX in Japan and Korea, I think the following efforts are needed for the shipbuilding business, the main industry in Korea, to dominate the global market. First, human and business restructuring should be carried out to improve the fundamental constitution to improve productivity.Second, we need to increase technological development. Through this, we need to secure stable profits in the future. Third, we need appropriate support from the government to secure liquidity. Through these three efforts, I believe that we will be able to secure the competitiveness of the domestic shipbuilding industry in foreign countries, and through these efforts, we will be able to have a positive impact on the local economy, exports and employment."",,,,"
"When I was in elementary school, I saw students sitting in front of a computer and programming at a computer academy run by my father. With a combination of English and letters full of screens, I became very curious about the actual program being executed, and the most attractive part was that I could make what I wanted. I was attracted to this and had a vague dream of majoring in computers. After that, I went to college with only a vague dream, but I was just stuck in learning unfamiliar languages and theories. At this time, what came to mind was a lesson of my alma mater, 'If you want to grow up, serve others'. I decided to immediately put what came to mind. First, I sat at the front of the classroom and actively asked questions, participated, and served the professor in my heart. As the content that I had never understood caught my head and eyes, I was able to proceed with undergraduate projects and projects. As I served not only the professor but also the seniors actively, I found myself developing my ego outside of study. It was only then that I understood the lessons of my alma mater, which I had never understood in high school, and from then on, I became my values. Since then, I have been learning with a low attitude while serving a big person. I attended the CES 2013 held in Las Vegas. I experienced new IT technologies from world-class companies at the CES, the world's largest electronics exhibition. It was an opportunity to look at many companies and feel that unless they settle for the current performance and make progress, they will lose their competitiveness and will be eliminated. Since then, I have always kept the two words ""development"" in mind while running. My goal is to strive to achieve my childhood dream of becoming an IT person through my values and words in my heart. After joining BC Card, I will reflect on my values and continue to improve and show myself to become a great person by serving senior citizens and customers from a low attitude to achieve my dream. ""Since trust given to customers in the payment and settlement industry is related to the company's status, I have to make constant efforts to build trust. Based on that trust, BC Card is a leading company in the industry, but I think we need to build more trust to become No. 1 in Asia payment services. The IT sector does not directly give that trust. However, I believe that by providing good services such as web pages and mobile devices, I can build trust in people indirectly. I want to become an IT employee who indirectly builds trust in BC Card. After joining the company, I will quickly learn necessary qualities such as accurate understanding of the program I am in charge of and acquiring financial knowledge, grow into an IT finance expert, and provide services suitable for BC Card. In addition, I will constantly understand IT technology trends and apply new technologies to existing IT services to make efforts for better IT services. And as the head of BC Card's IT department within 20 years, I will achieve my dream of becoming the best financial computer in Korea."" At the time of OOO internship, I had to modify the network due to the need to change the test environment. Although a large-scale change was needed, I had a fear that it would be impossible because it was not given to wires and equipment, perhaps due to the environment that I had maintained for a long time. However, by joining forces with my motives, I decided to introduce and change a new systematic method, and I decided to proceed with the work using both. 1. RackTables tool 2. I thought that it would be easy for others to change the environment later if I changed it using two methods of physical cycles. I wrote the cycle and tool while going back and forth to the server room and checking the line directly over the phone. As a result, I built the desired test environment. If I had done it alone, I might have given up thinking it was impossible, but I think I got good results as I ran with the team members. Through teamwork, I learned that anything can be solved if I proceed with goals and how to solve things. During the school festival in 2012, a bar was held in Somoim, but there was a situation where the delivery of the festival items I ordered was delayed. I received a customer on time because I thought that the goods would naturally arrive at the time I reserved, but when I called, I had to wait a little bit. I couldn't betray the customer's expectations, so I went to Somoim next to talk about the necessary items and started trading. We were the only ones who rented sound equipment, but instead of borrowing the necessary items, they asked us to rent it for a certain amount of time. Since I couldn't disappoint my customers, I decided to lend them to them with responsibility and the deal was concluded. However, due to the nature of the sound and atmosphere, other consumption items became an atmosphere where they could enjoy together from the beginning, and when it came time to promise, other consumption items said that this was enough and did not have to lend them. Based on trust, I came to think about the importance of trust, creating the effect of two trillion won in keeping promises with customers and learning cooperation through transactions."" Currently, the card industry is in an essential position in finance with the cooperation of banks and securities as its usage has increased more than cash. I want to grow from the IT department in the card industry to develop with future technologies, beyond simple cards, to become a financial IT person, and I have prepared two competencies. First, among the various competencies that members of IT must have, I thought that the most important thing was the basic IT competency, so I wanted to have a firm domain for my major in computer. Through my undergraduate program, I took various major skills such as Database and C. Java. In addition, I completed training on the web, Java, and DB through the DB Employment Academy training, and proceeded with the project. The second is the ability to improve service quality. OO intern wanted to find and manage bugs through HW and SW QA and provide stable quality products to customers. We tried to grow the program by supplementing TestCase, not just finding bugs.""???,,,"
"I was so interested in Linux that I was told that the combination of MYSQL and Linux was the best while studying. That story made me curious about MYSQL and the database, and I started studying. Since it is the last semester, I am studying while taking a database course with curiosity and enthusiasm for learning despite people around me asking me to leave as much time as possible to prepare for employment. The study, which started with curiosity, has turned into a joy of getting to know the database as time goes by, and I am only studying DB like a racehorse running while looking ahead. I think I need to be in the best group in order to be the best in one field, so it is not an exaggeration to say that all the information in Korea passes, and I saw the announcement on the job category that best fits my passion for my DB and network, and above all, I was encouraged to apply for passion. I think I can become the best DB expert in Korea, combined with my passion for DB, if I have the opportunity to learn about databases such as MYSQL and MongoDB from Kakao, which has the technology and data to connect people and the world beyond the limits of time and space, and make it happen, and I will do my best to make Kakao the most advanced company not only in Korea but also in the world. [Efforts for Growth] As of July 2015, I finished my sixth semester and became qualified for the article test. My goal was to get an information processing technician, information security technician, and Linux Master 1 level certificate during the second half of the year. Starting with basic information processing technicians, information security technicians to learn more about security and networks, and to study Linux, which is essential in the network sector. I was told by people around me to prepare one thing with certainty, but I started with the idea that I should do it. I prepared for the test by studying the overlapping operating system and network part first, and the additional part of the test ahead of the test date. I studied by reducing my bedtime and using my free time because I studied at the same time as my school class and part-time job, and although I was tired, I was more happy to know things I didn't know because I studied my favorite field. The unsatisfactory results were final pass for information processing technician, written pass for information security technician, and fail for Linux master, but I found that if I work hard with a mindset that I can do even if the result is not satisfactory, I can learn and feel a lot in the process. However, I will try harder to achieve satisfactory results from now on, and I passed the Linux Master Writing Test and am preparing for the Linux Master Practical Test and the Information Security Technician Practical Test in May. My next goal is to pass the recruitment of new employees for Kakao's Global Database Product. I think the greatest genius among geniuses is the genius of hard work. I will become a genius in my efforts and utilize all my capabilities for the development of Kakao."" [SafeRiding] I worked as a team to create a graduation work and proceeded with the project. My team used SafeRiding to combine RaspberryPi, Arduino, and Application to prevent drivers' safety accidents and theft of bicycles with functions such as rear detection using a camera and object detection using ultrasonic waves. I was in charge of RaspberryPi. Two-way communication through RaspberryPi of data values received using various sensors such as Arduino's ultrasonic sensors, LEDs, and gyro sensors, as well as through the input of applications and GPS values should have been possible. With RaspberryPi as the server, which serves as the middle bridge, communication control between Arduino and the application, and at the same time, I assisted in the programming of RaspberryPi. I used Python and Bash Script for the programming of RaspberryPi, which is based on Linux. After many meetings and tests on which communication technology should be used to enable the most optimized communication, we decided to communicate with Arduino using Bluetooth for communication with the application and Web-Streaming for Cam Streaming. It was our first time to encounter the equipment, technologies, and languages used, and we studied each technology before proceeding with the project, filling in the gaps. In the initial test, Bluetooth programming was performed on two-way communication, but it was a problem because communication was not achieved due to overlapping channels. And even in Web-Streaming, when I accessed the URL directly from the web, I saw a video, but there was a problem that was not visible in the application. I tried many things, such as changing and re-creating the code of the Bluetooth connection program, but it was not easy to solve it. Meanwhile, while I was looking at the code step by step from the beginning, I realized that the problem was really only one sentence of the code. With that, I learned how important each code I write in programming is. The problem in Web-Streaming was solved by coding in a format other than the first code I wrote because it was difficult to find which part was wrong, although the video was properly displayed in RaspberryPi. [Experience and Learning] When I was working as an office assistant at the election committee in Gangseo-gu, Seoul, the manager suggested early voting machines and networks and gladly accepted it.I was in charge of training the employees and part-timers of each dong office on how to install and operate the equipment, and conducting and guiding tests in preparation for the day of voting. The test was conducted by checking the connection log and controlling network traffic in Gangseo-gu, and if there was a problem, the network equipment of the polling station was re-examined. Thirty minutes before the start of the early voting, I was briefed on encrypted USB execution and network connection problems in two dongs where there were no problems, and my manager and I went to the polling station respectively. Since I didn't have time to check the problem, I explained to the manager over the phone, and at the same time, I was able to set up and encrypt the hub after replacing it, and I was able to start voting on time. I think that if the skills I learned while managing the network at the district level and learning at Kakao are combined, I think I will be a talented person worthy of Kakao,,,"
"[Growing up with Daewon Pharmaceutical] I have accumulated overall IT knowledge by taking various courses such as HW, SW, and network when I was an undergraduate. In addition, I have acquired basic qualifications as an IT expert by not stopping at lectures, working on various projects, obtaining information processing technicians, and CCNA certificates. I applied because I thought that my capabilities and interests could create synergy with Daewon Pharmaceutical. When selecting a company that is another starting point in my life, I think about whether it is a company that can grow continuously rather than the current situation. In this regard, Daewon Pharmaceutical does not stay in the present, but has a firm goal of 'living a healthy life for the people' and achieving 500 billion won', and I think that there are more ways to go than there have been in the future. In order to grow with Daewon Pharmaceutical like this, I will first become a new employee who is concerned about the operation management of network and server systems and the achievement of goals based on a complete understanding of the internal processes of Daewon Pharmaceutical. Based on this, I will become a member of Daewon Pharmaceutical, which keeps its promise of maximizing customer value, with better changes occurring with my colleagues every year. [passion leading to responsibility] I have the advantage of being active in anything with the tenet of 'Everything has learning.' During college, I actively built up my IT knowledge, and while riding, I learned physical strength and persistence. Like this, I am committed to doing my best in anything. This kind of strength has always been the driving force that makes me do my best with a sense of responsibility. This driving force has been the power to push ahead with work and produce results when working on team projects. These strengths and driving forces greatly help Daewon Pharmaceutical's growth and I am confident that they will lead to results. On the other hand, my supplementary point is that I often hear the tired voices of my team members when working on team projects due to my too-active attitude. To compensate for this, I am solving this problem by communicating with my team members and taking a break through meals and drinking parties. As a member of Daewon Pharmaceutical, I will become an employee who actively engages in anything with responsibility. I will also demonstrate synergy of cooperation by communicating with my colleagues frequently."""" and ""[Talented human resources that Daewon Pharmaceutical is looking for] I have made various efforts to become a human resource that meets the expectations of society as well as Daewon Pharmaceutical, which prioritizes 'customer satisfaction'. First, I have acquired not only knowledge of network and database but also knowledge of server in my major classes and private IT institutions. In particular, I was more interested in Network, my major field, and obtained a CCNA certificate, which qualified me as a network manager and gave me the basics. Second, during my undergraduate years, I conducted Term Projects related to my major, and through this, I developed meticulousness and meticulous analysis. When errors were found in coding within the project, I analyzed them line by line with my colleagues and completed the project by debugging until I found them. Such meticulousness and meticulousness could lead to achievements and led to a strong sense of responsibility. Rather than staying in these competencies, I will continue to develop more expertise in the network field and obtain a CCNP certificate. In addition, I will become a talented person who grows up with Daewon Pharmaceutical by preparing information security technicians to become IT professionals who can cope with security issues."",""[Searching for alternatives] When a road collapsed due to heavy rain during the long journey of bicycle country, I safely traveled to my destination in search of alternatives to meet the schedule with my members. In the summer of 2014, I visited the long journey of 700 km from Haenam to Seoul on the national highway rather than the bicycle path. During the long journey, a heavy rain caused the road to collapse. As a result, I was unable to safely travel to the accommodations I had reserved, and all my colleagues started to tremble. I spent the day safely with some of the staff, and went around looking for areas where I could proceed with my next schedule, and fortunately, I decided to get accommodations provided at a nearby cathedral on condition of cleaning up. In addition, other fees were contacted in advance and even a patrol car was recruited so that I could proceed safely. Although I felt heavier while running around looking for a solution, I felt that we were able to proceed without anyone getting hurt thanks to all of our efforts, so I was lighthearted. As mentioned above, I want to be one member of the group in which we, not one person, join forces to solve problems."",""""[If there is no first step, there is no second step."" During my undergraduate years, I worked for the English conversation club ""AVES"" and participated in the ""Chungcheong-do University Student English Speech Contest."" As I studied in the natural world and engineering college, I was afraid of English because I only dealt with numbers, formulas, and sensors rather than foreign languages. So, I joined an English conversation club on campus, talked in English twice a week, and had games and discussions. Although I got used to English through club activities, I still had my fears. Meanwhile, I learned about the ""Chungcheong-do University Student English Speech Contest"" hosted by the school and decided to participate in it. In the process of choosing a theme and writing Korean manuscripts and translating English, my fears gradually disappeared. After all, I successfully completed my English speech in the first order on the day of the contest after much effort. Although I did not win the prize, it was an opportunity to get rid of my fear of English and start studying English. This opportunity continues to this day, and I am attending English conversation studies every morning along with studying English such as TOEIC and Opic. As a member of Daewon Pharmaceutical, I will become a talented person who does not fear failure and grows based on continuous challenges."",,,,"
"[No one knows our department] I want to make sure that no one knows the existence of our IT operation department. The most obvious thing about the existence of the IT operation department is when there is an IT problem. If there is no IT problem, no one will visit the IT department. I want to provide a stable IT environment to other departments through stable IT operation so that it does not interfere with their work, so that the IT operation department does not emerge as a concern. To this end, we will try to minimize inconvenience by understanding the characteristics of work of not only the IT operation department but also other departments by considering their perspectives. [Solving even minor problems] We developed a 'chat program using COM ports' as an undergraduate project. At that time, a code to send packets was given, but if you use that code as it is, the latter part of the message did not send well if the message was longer than a certain length. The code part was given as a basic, so it did not affect the task score, but I analyzed the cause to solve this problem. The problem occurred due to the speed difference between SW and HW, and to solve this problem, we solved the problem through a delay between message transmissions. In the end, I was able to get a good grade called A+ by solving the only problem. In this way, I will become a talented person who solves even the smallest problem without overlooking it and prepares other departments of Hanwha Life to avoid any problems. ""I am a person who enjoys challenging myself. When setting goals, I always defiantly set goals and enjoy the process of reaching them. I have experience in creating a 'similar torrent program' as an undergraduate class assignment. The assignment was to produce a 'file transfer program', but since the score was set on a relative basis based on the function and completeness of the program, I decided to develop a torrent program rather than a simple file transfer program. However, to do this, I was short on time to learn many knowledge such as file distribution principles, file processing, transmission protocols, and multiple threads. So, I organized the knowledge I needed to learn, made a learning plan, and studied the knowledge necessary for development step by step. Various examples were analyzed by referring to the Internet and books, and applied to the program's development. When using multiple threads during development, things did not go as I wanted, so I visited my assistant and got help for 3 hours, and when using TCP/IP protocol, I hung on for 10 hours to solve the problem. After many trials and errors, I successfully developed the program and achieved good result, ranking first in assignment grade. From this, I learned that setting challenging goals is not smooth, but when I reach them, great achievements come along, and since then, I have set challenging goals that are beyond my ability and have been making great efforts to achieve them."" When I was a re-taker, I happened to meet Kim Tae-won, the author of Young Googler's Letter to the Dead Passion, on the subway. This book was given as a gift from my homeroom teacher when I was in high school, but I did not just receive the gift and read it. Before we met on the subway and parted five stops later, Kim gave me heartfelt advice, telling me about his re-taking experience. Kim's advice comforted me, who was discouraged. That night, I read the book I received from my teacher from the beginning. In the book, Kim emphasizes passion. The passion that he does not practice is just a piece of hot water, and the qualification is not to fill in with English scores or awards, but to how passionately he lived the given time. After reading the book, I was deeply impressed, and it gave me a chance to focus on my studies again, so I successfully completed my re-examination. Even when I came to college, I tried to have various experiences for myself in the future, not just for a line of my resume. Sometimes, when I feel like my passion has cooled down and I feel lethargic, I take out the book and calm myself by rereading it. Even now, several years later, the meeting was an unforgettable turning point in my life. I will not work passively, but to become a talented person who deals with the passion of my heart."", ""Can't everyone use it easily?"" When I was in the sixth grade of elementary school, I accidentally purchased a PC magazine at a bookstore and became attracted to computers. As I often fixed the computers of my acquaintances thanks to my interest in computers, I found that computers have already come deep into our lives, but most people cannot easily handle them. Since then, my dream has become to make computers easy for everyone. This dream led to various mentoring programs during my undergraduate years. I participated in mentoring programs for non-majors and tutoring programs for international students to help them learn by delivering my accumulated know-how and major knowledge. In addition, I found out that my parents use the music playback app on their smartphones, but they are not familiar with the interface, making it difficult to use it. To solve this problem, I developed my own music playback app with a more intuitive interface. I researched the inconveniences of using existing apps for the elderly, including parents and uncles who are not familiar with machines, and I developed the app that has an interface that is easy for anyone to operate by reflecting this. After development, I received and supplemented the feedback to create a music playback app that is easy for people who are not familiar with machines to use. As such, Hanwha Life Insurance will also make an effort to provide a stable IT environment to other departments through my will to make computers easy for everyone to use,,,"
"[World Standard Bank] When I was an undergraduate at HW, SW, and Network, I was most fascinated by Network. Network makes all companies more active in their business activities and ensures a more convenient life for ordinary people as well. In order to become an expert on this network, I obtained the CCNA license and checked the virtual network with my own eyes during the acquisition process to deepen my understanding. I applied because I thought that these capabilities and interests could create synergy with SC Bank. I think a company is another starting point in my life. So, when choosing a company, I think about whether it is a company that can sustainable growth rather than just look at the current situation. In this respect, SC Bank is not only complacent about the current financial transactions, but also has an innovative goal of Digital Main Bank, and I think there are more ways to go than there have been in the future. In order to grow with such a SC bank, I will be a new employee who considers network and server system operation management and achievement of goals based on a thorough understanding of internal processes of SC bank for one year after joining the company. In addition, I will focus on understanding database so as not to neglect DATA management, and take a step closer to Digital Main Bank by obtaining DBA certificate. I will do my best to operate the system so that I can become a leader as Digital Main Bank of Korea in five years. In addition, I will be interested in ways to make more active business with not only domestic but also foreign partners through continuous development of SC bank system. In 10 years, as one of the executives of SC bank, I will proceed with the project to think about the new 10 years by establishing a network system so that financial activities that go through SC can be conducted all over the world. I will become an SC person who keeps my promise to maximize customer value, with better changes occurring with my colleagues every year.""[Carefully] My superpower is meticulous analysis with my colleagues. When I was in college, I worked on a project with Raspberry Pi through a course called Internet communication design. Through the progress of the project, I learned the power of teamwork and the need for careful analysis. The theme of our team was 'library seat system'. However, we added a led notification function and a web seat management function that informs users of the seat end time, not only to imitate the current library system. We divided our parts and proceeded with coding. I was in charge of controlling the seat display LED through socket communication. At first, we thought that we could derive and synthesize the results for each part, so we performed coding work separately. When I combined the socket communication coding I was in charge of with the coding brought by the other team members, there was an error in coding because parts were not harmonized. Perhaps due to repeated errors, all of the team members were tired. However, we analyzed the coding in detail to get good grades by completing the project. As a result of analyzing the entire coding line by line, and organizing the errors, we were able to complete the project. If it weren't for the team members, I would have been frustrated and wanted to give up by myself. Also, I was able to produce results thanks to careful analysis, checking even the smallest 'dot' and analyzing it carefully. Through my superpower, I will become an employee who achieves my goals and grows even more with SC."""" and ""[Talent qualified for SC] I have made various efforts to become a talented person who meets the expectations of society as well as SC Bank's management policy of 'to be with you all the time."" First, I have acquired not only network and database knowledge but also server knowledge in my major classes and private IT institutions. In particular, I was more interested in Network, my major, and obtained a CCNA certificate, which qualified me as a network manager and equipped me with basic skills. Second, during my undergraduate years, I conducted a Term Project related to my major, and through this, I developed meticulousness and meticulous analysis. When errors were found in the coding in the project, I analyzed them line by line and completed the project by debugging until I found them. Such meticulousness and meticulousness could lead to achievements and led to a strong sense of responsibility. Third, it is the ability to smoothly solve problems no matter what problems arise outside of my expertise. When my schedule was disrupted by a heavy rain caused by the collapse of a road during the long journey of bicycle country in my undergraduate years, I looked for alternatives to meet the schedule and had my members safely get to their destinations. As a staff member, I was obliged to ensure the safety of my team members, so I was worried that the roads would be cut off and that I might not be able to go to the accommodations I had reserved. With the permission of the team leader, I looked for the fastest way to proceed as scheduled and a school that could rent a playground or auditorium. Fortunately, I was contacted by a nearby cathedral that they would provide accommodation for cleaning, so I was able to recruit a patrol car and proceed with the schedule. Even though I was heavier while running around looking for a solution, I felt light because I was able to continue without anyone getting hurt. As such, I remain active for the safety of everyone outside of my area of expertise. I am confident that these are qualities that satisfy all of us, including our customers, through the operation of SC Bank's system."" [First Mover: SC] SC Bank is considered the first mover in the financial industry. Recently, I read a book called 'First Mover' by Peter Underwood. First Mover means ""leader of new field."" The reason why SC Bank thought 'First Mover' was because it was the fastest to go digital. Most of the business processing in many fields, including financial affairs, is carried out by the computer, network, database, etc. It is expected that more IT technologies will be deployed without changing this trend.Although its main business is finance, it is preparing for the future by hiring IT professionals such as Network, Server, and Data. We expect that such thorough preparations will show great efficiency in the ongoing operation of the Bank Shop. In addition, we will be able to grow one step further if we have more safety in this simpler financial market. If we continue to pay attention to IT investment as well as financial security issues, I think these can be directly related to customer satisfaction. I am confident that the energy of customer satisfaction will enable us to reach Digital Main Bank, which SC Bank has aimed for, as soon as possible, and become a leader in the financial industry.""[Capstone Design: Making Air Conditioners by Infrared Temperature Measurement] I have experience creating works that participate in the design of Capstone for my graduation work in college. The work we produced was an infrared temperature sensor for an air conditioner. The goal was to place it in front of the desk for office workers in Korea, which has the second largest working hours in the world, and to operate the air conditioner in accordance with the temperature. The base controls hardware parts such as motors and temperature sensors in Arduino, and Bluetooth communication with the database in Raspberry Pi, so that the cooler operates according to the current temperature values and adjusts the strength and weakness. In addition, the measured current temperature values can be viewed on the web in conjunction with php so that users can monitor them in real time. Among them, I was in charge of the Bluetooth communication part that transmits temperature values from Arduino to Raspberry Pi, the current temperature values measured by Arduino in myadmin, the database built by Arduino, and the part that transmits and expresses the current temperature values to php (web). Among them, the most memorable part was about the database. In this process, we executed an Insert command that communicates serial with a port number and inserts the data received through the 'execute' command into the database. These commands were theoretically learned through a subject called database design, but I was very interested because it was the first time to build and input values through communication. As such, just because my major is a network, I am not limited to a network, but I have gained knowledge of the database and implemented it myself through projects. Through my network and database capabilities, I will be a very helpful employee in the operation of the SC information system.""???,,,"
"[A person who communicates with the outside world] I am considerate and have excellent harmony skills, so I can increase the efficiency of the team by leading the team members in a comfortable atmosphere and speaking freely. In the software analysis design subject, we analyzed and designed services by applying object-oriented design patterns. Our group created a service that allows people to participate in donations and volunteer activities, and we created a blueprint by applying GRASP and GOF patterns. With my unique positive energy, I made the group atmosphere amicable, and my teamwork improved, so the work efficiency increased. Even if I invested the same amount of time, I was able to work more efficiently compared to other groups, and I ended up winning first place in the project. Even after I came to university, I served as an executive of a club called 00 that shines, and I am called the godmother of 00 because I have a wide network of connections and are close friends there. [Those who contribute to the growth of the organization] When I served as an executive of club 00, I wanted to be helpful to the club, so I tried to solve the employment problem, which was a concern for many members. To this end, in order to create a place for information exchange with seniors who are active in the field, the OBYB meeting, which had been abolished, was revived. There were many negative reactions that they would fail, and there were times when I wanted to give up because I couldn't reach the seniors. However, he said that he was able to hold the event because he believed that he could, and that it was a satisfactory time for both seniors and juniors. It is rewarding to see that I contribute to the growth of the organization and the members of the organization feel satisfied because of me. If I join Hansol Group, I will be the person who leads the company on a better path with this mindset.""[Success story: The spirit of not knowing how to give up] **When I was an intern at Electronics, I successfully developed the return scanner, and I stopped giving up thinking about my joy after success even though I had a hard work. Although it was a short internship, I wanted to learn a lot and challenged the development task. My task was to develop a return scanner that would allow the scanner motor to scan not only when it departs from home but also when it returns to reduce the time it takes to scan. I had to analyze the code that was actually used, but it was very difficult because it was large and complicated. However, the harder it was, the more I burned down, and I did not give up, imagining after success whenever I had a hard time. I analyzed the code flow, drew a flowchart, and tried to understand the functions and variables I studied by organizing them in documents. Every time I corrected the code one by one, a new error occurred, but it was a fun time, and I was very happy when the development was successful. With this opportunity, I did not give up no matter how difficult I took on the difficult task. Even after joining Hansol Group, I will be willing to challenge difficult tasks by utilizing my strengths, and I will succeed in my work with a spirit that does not know how to give up. [Failure Case: Realizing the Importance of Collaboration] I was working on a project dealing with ARM-based embedded equipment, and I received a mid-low grade, and I learned the importance of collaboration at this opportunity. All the members of the group were unfamiliar because it was their first time with embedded, and the process of handling the equipment did not go as planned. In addition, since I had to use school equipment, time distribution was very important because it could only be developed when the lab was open from 6 to 9 p.m. every evening. I started to give up one by one for difficult and awkward tasks, and I was unable to read them all. Eventually, the project had to be carried out alone, and although it was completed, the level was low, so I received a mid- to low-level score. There are limitations to what you do alone. If I join Hansol Group, I will cherish my colleagues and create a greater synergy effect by always cooperating with them."""" ""You may think that the job as a developer [a developer contributing to society] is not directly related to customers, but I think this is an old saying."" In the information technology society, what is inseparable in real life is the IT field, and I think this field, which can change society depending on what services are provided and created, is in direct contact with customers and society more than any other field. In that sense, I want to make a great contribution to helping people and making society more convenient. Hansol always tries to find the answer that customers want from the customer's point of view, and tries to get the company and customers close. If I join Hansol, I will be able to achieve my goal, so I applied. [Both open source analysis ability and experience in various projects] I have a lot of experience in programming, so I can handle any task quickly and efficiently. Also, there are many things to study and modify open sources when I enter a company, so the ability to understand open sources is a very important requirement for developers, and since I have them, I can contribute to the company. *Academy*, an Android curriculum, successfully developed an application called 000 000, and during the development process, we practiced a lot to study and modify open sources. For the first time at the time of development, we collaborated with designers and planners who are people from other fields, and it was a beneficial time to learn how to analyze applications from various perspectives as well as from the perspective of developers. 000 is an application that shows weather, traffic, D-Day, and memo information at a glance on a busy morning, and it has now over 2,500 downloads on **** and has become the best application in the fourth week of January. It has also been featured in articles on Money Today and Daily Sports. In addition, we have developed casino games, employee management programs, volunteer programs, shopping cart applications, customized date course recommendations, and return scanners.""[Customized date course recommendation application: 00] 00 is an application that combines big data and data mining to analyze user preferences and recommend customized date courses.When I search for attractions in the area for a date, it is difficult to determine whether they are authentic or not because most of them are advertising texts, and when I look at the courses designed by others, I often don't like them, so I often look for them and design them myself. I started with the intention of making it more comfortable and creating a service that designs the course to each other's taste. During the group meeting, I came up with a number of ideas through brainstorming, and I decided to choose the most necessary and novel one, so I selected 00 that I presented the agenda. Since it was a large-scale project, there were many development issues and it was more difficult to coordinate opinions compared to other projects, but I did not have a big problem because I actively stepped forward and helped them if there was a group who needed help along with a caring attitude. In addition, there were technical difficulties in the development process and problems that occurred because the ideas were not embodied, and the group members held meetings from time to time to discuss ideas and came up with the next best idea. After these efforts, I was able to complete the development safely, and I was able to win an idea award at the LINC Project Group Awards hosted by the university. Also, I always wonder if there is a way to make my work more efficient. Even when I was working part-time, I changed the location of existing items to make the movement easier. Once the location of the item has been determined, people get used to it and don't think about changing it easily. After I changed it, everyone I worked with liked it, saying it was convenient. When it's time for a meeting, I'm active in coming up with ideas without being embarrassed. There are many good opinions after refining and revising opinions that I think are somewhat absurd. When I join Hansol Group, I will try to create new and valuable services."""" [Coding Mania] I'm so excited that I can't tell the time goes by when I'm working on programming, and I'm also talented in this field. It's not that I did well from the beginning. The languages I first encountered when I was a freshman were unfamiliar and difficult, so I tried again two or three times in class and often asked questions to professors. Nevertheless, I was frustrated because my test score was not good, but I didn't feel that I lost interest or didn't want to do it. Then, as I gradually improved, I fell in love with coding, and it became fun, so I actively participated in team projects, and when I got a coding assignment, I was itching to do it quickly. As a result, I often hear that my friends come and ask me questions, and during the project, I become a development leader, and I have a talent for programming. As I gradually felt that there was a difference in skills with my colleagues, I was motivated to improve further in this field. As I worked hard, I received 4.5, received first place in database, computer advanced structure, software analysis design, grades, and team projects. As an intern, I also received first place in a team project. I also applied for an Android expert course run by T Academy to develop an application because I wanted to have a lot of experience in programming, and I challenged the development work as an intern. Now, I want to move away from the undergraduate level and develop something that can be used in practice and contribute socially. There will inevitably be a qualitative difference between what you just do and what you enjoy doing. Even if I join Hansol Group, I will work happily and make it different from other services both quantitatively and qualitatively."",,"
"I completed a comprehensive design project and worked on a project called OpenCopter with my undergraduate students. OpenCopter is a combination of open source and quadcopter, and we started with the goal of lowering the unit price of expensive quadcopter by creating and distributing code ourselves for free. It was a short-term project, so we could have created applications or made simple programs, but our team was greedy and decided to create a quadcopter that recognizes and tracks people. It was impossible to complete the project within the period of time while working on it at the same time as my studies, but I decided to do it as much as possible by dividing it into floating a quadcopter, making an application remote control, and using a camera to recognize and track people. I was in charge of the tracking part. After receiving the video from the camera, it was subjected to a Gaussian Filter process to remove noise, and the specific color was binarized into white and all other colors were binarized into black. Thus, the direction of movement was determined by calculating the distance and angle between the center point of the white area and the center point of the video. And we created an algorithm that determines the area of the white area and the forward and backwardness by the area size. We were able to complete the project and participate in the exhibition thanks to the division of labor in pairs. However, it was regrettable that there were many shortcomings when the algorithm was produced using simple binarization processing due to the lack of time. Since it only tracks specific colors, it fell without recognizing when the person was behind the object. Moreover, since the forward and backward movement was determined based on the area alone, the range of the white area narrowed when the person looked straight ahead and turned to the side, recognizing that the object was far away, and there was a risk of collision with the object due to the quadcopter moving forward. After the exhibition was over, we tried to improve the problems by bringing an opencopter, but there was a limit to dealing with all exceptions at our level. Inevitably, we went to an Internet cafe and completed it with the advice and source of experts. I could have participated in the exhibition as a simple project, but I could learn more because I set a high goal and tried hard.""********** I volunteered at a local children's center for two years. As the chairman of the volunteer group, I organized weekly meetings and helped communicate between the center and the volunteers. After a long period of time, I learned about the internal situation of the center. Since the center is operated only with regular donations, there was a limited number of people who could take care of it. The head of the center was always saddened by the fact that many children wanted to enter the center but could no longer accept the offer, and I decided to find a way to increase the donation. Back then, leaflet distribution was the only way to recruit sponsors. Palm-sized leaflets were small enough to contain the urgency of the center, and they were expensive and inefficient because they could not be distributed in many places. To address this issue, I suggested creating a newspaper called ""The Story of the Persimmon Tree"" instead of leaflets. Newspapers were black and white but easy to see for the elderly in large letters, and they were able to distribute them to a wide area due to the low cost of producing and printing newspapers. Every weekend, I worked hard on newspaper production with volunteers. I drew the cover myself and posted pictures of the children. The newspaper was produced in a total of eight pages, and on the last page, I expressed my gratitude by putting the names of my sponsors. And to show the transparent use of donations, I included the expenditure details. Thanks to the many volunteers' participation in newspaper production, we were able to start distributing the newspaper within two weeks of deciding to produce it. A week later, the volunteers' earnestness was conveyed, and three or four calls a day began to come in asking for sponsorship. Thanks to the new sponsors, I was able to receive children who had delayed admission to the center. Since then, ""The Story of the Gamnamugol"" has been published regularly and has been a great help in recruiting many sponsors. ""When I was a student, I was shy, so I couldn't open my heart first. While going to high school, I joined a theater club to improve my shortcomings. I was immersed in the club slogan, ""When we are apart, it is one drop, but when we gather, we become an ocean,"" and prepared for the performance every day. For the first month, my daily routine was to be criticized and scolded by my seniors. The stage fright I usually had did not go away easily, and unlike my initial determination, I found myself getting depressed. I thought that if I couldn't overcome my fear this time, I would easily give up on anything in the future, and from that day on, I took a video of my lines for two to three hours a day, and practiced through the mirror, discovering problems on my own. After two to three weeks of repeated practice, I was told that my skills have improved. After receiving a few compliments, at some point, I found that I enjoyed the play without getting stressed out. For the remaining two months, I participated in the practice more than anyone else. The practice time that I had hoped for the end was changed from ""practice time that would be over"" to ""practice time that would make me feel sad to finish"", and the teamwork with colleagues also increased, and in the latter half of the practice, I changed into a passionate figure, such as voluntarily practicing additional practice with the actors and editing the script. I played my role safely on the day of the performance. Although I was not the first place as an actor, I received reviews from my colleagues that I have improved more than any other 20 actors. The overwhelming feeling of praise and applause from the audience and friends of the day still lingers in my heart, as I was proud of myself for turning what I once wanted to do into the most enjoyable thing. Through this, I was able to realize the greatness of my efforts and discover the potential for my own development."" ""Theatrical during high school was a valuable experience that changed me."" Even after going to university, I joined a club called 'San Sarang' and continued to do theater and mountain climbing activities with attachment. After just finishing my second year of university, I was given a project task related to my major for promotion to the club.It was an opportunity to receive a subsidy of 5 million won when exhibiting the project after carrying out the assignment. I recruited team members to carry out the project, but the fourth grade with extensive project experience was busy preparing for employment, and the first grade was not experienced enough to carry out the project. The operation of the membership fee for the purpose of running the club was not smooth, so I challenged the project with the goal of applying for some 3rd graders, including myself. In line with the club name, the theme was to implement an information application in the mountains nationwide, and we pledged to achieve the best results with our members and responsibility. For us who did not have knowledge of the application, the graduation project-level task was too high a wall. There was a fear among the team members, 'Wouldn't we fail?' and there were small disputes at each meeting. At the suggestion of a classmate as the team leader, he studied the amount he was in charge of in advance, made a prototype, and started a study to teach other team members, and the application was gradually completed as the study continued. Through the efforts and cooperation among the team members, we were able to complete the task within the deadline. Since most of the exhibitions were projects by the 4th graders, our works were relatively insufficient. However, I was able to get a lot of points because I was the result of my first assignment and the absence of a fourth grader. This served as a decisive opportunity to be promoted from an existing theater club to a major club, and it gave me confidence in my major. ""I developed the web at BaxterIP IT team, a law firm based in Sydney, Australia. My first project was to create a responsive web. I had basic knowledge of responsive web but had no experience in implementing it, so I studied by looking at materials and sources after work every day, and I took charge of creating navigation to implement it. The next project started with my proposal. Due to the nature of the company, counseling with customers was frequent, but there were not enough telephone consultants and the number of branches was small, making it difficult to visit the company. I thought that it would be helpful to attract customers if I created a bulletin board by adding a membership registration/login function and consulted on the homepage. The CEO and the supervisor were interested in my idea and focused on implementing the bulletin board for the last week. I used phpmyadmin to encrypt and store the customer's information in a DB, and when I post on the homepage, I implemented a function that is sent by e-mail. Through the intern, I have experienced and learned not only my major knowledge but also work. Although I am still learning it, I have been creating work momentum by demonstrating my supervisor's know-how and my own strengths, such as writing work mail, prioritizing work, and making plans and processing it. Also, my philosophy - 'People come before work.' I realized that the root cause of happiness and stress, big and small, at work is not work, but human relationships. Finally, what you can do today is not to postpone it until tomorrow. Tomorrow is tomorrow's work, and if you have accumulated work, you will always have a busy day, and if this continues, you may get tired. All of these are my own assets obtained through practical work. I majored in computer engineering and took IT-related courses such as data communication and database, and in the process, I laid the foundation by working on various projects. In addition, the excellent grades of data structure and algorithms prove that my analytical and solving skills are excellent. I promise that the knowledge and experience I have will help maintain SK's status."",,,,"
"In this era when what I imagine becomes a reality, I think IT is the biggest value-added industry of the future. As a non-majors, it hasn't been long since I turned to IT, but I think non-majors are a bigger major for me with various experiences and backgrounds. I want to grow into the best developer in your company. My strength is my ability to immerse myself in something. I have a strong sense of improvement, so I have the ability to dig in to the point where I am scared when there is something I want to do well. I am still at the top of my class by taking classes alongside my majors. The downside is that I lack of verbal skills and have narrow human relationships. However, when I have to be active, I am consciously making efforts. As I think communication skills are the most important factor regardless of field, I will try to become an active and communicating IT person in the future."" This course runs from June this year to early January next year, and I am currently taking intensive education from 9 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. at an IT educational institution.

As a practitioner, I will do my best to improve myself every day to fill in areas that I lack and become an expert. I want to grow into a full stack dev ops. In addition, the IT field will continue to grow and become an increasingly borderless field, so I will become a globally competent developer based on the foreign languages I have studied so far."
"I am a person who can fulfill my responsibilities by finding the responsibility to take the initiative in the work entrusted to me. When I had to decide something from an early age, I made my own decisions, developed responsibility, and tried to do the leading work accordingly. For example, I participated in a Chinese training program hosted by a college and took on the role of the team leader. At the beginning of the training, all of the students participated hard in class, but in the middle of the training, many students became lazy, so they oversleep and did not attend, so they came up with measures to fulfill their role as team leader. I was encouraged to go to class by getting up early every morning, getting ready first, and going to the room where the students lived, waking them up in person. It was hotter and humid summer weather than Korea, so when I walked around, I sweated for no reason that I took a shower, and I was annoyed to see my friends who were not encouraged to go together. However, I have constantly tried to do my part and have led almost all students back to class. As a result, I was able to complete the training well together, and I was able to grow my sense of responsibility by being thanked for the effort I made to my Chinese teachers as well. Based on my strengths, calmness and meticulousness, I will do my job thoroughly. Programming and software management sometimes take more time to shake mentally when a problem arises in the process of debugging that makes it difficult to know the cause of the problem. However, my calmness has been a solution that allows me to take an engineering approach to the problem without panicking when a problem arises, and to find the cause of the problem based on meticulousness. The downside is the indecision caused by listening to many people. When deciding on something, I try to listen to everyone's story to make the best decision for everyone. In the process, both this person and I have a point, so there are moments when it is difficult to make a decision, but I have made the best decision through many conversations with them. When I joined GS Neotech, I will try to find a conclusion that can produce satisfactory results for all stakeholders."" ""The most successful and meaningful thing was to create an application with my team members to participate in the contest. On the last vacation of my studies, I wanted to have a result that summarizes the knowledge I had learned through my major classes and the practical experience I had gained while working at the research institute, so I persuaded my colleagues to form a team with four colleagues, and among them, I took the role of project manager to achieve satisfactory results through cooperation and consideration with my team members. The first reason that was meaningful was that I was able to apply my major knowledge and practical experience that I had gained so far by participating in everything from planning to design, server and client implementation. By participating in government projects in various major classes and research institutes, I was able to adapt to various development environments, enhance my understanding of software development, and create a complete application based on this. At the planning stage, I proposed the theme of social network using beacons, and started the project with the unanimous consent of my team members, and I carried out the design based on my software engineering knowledge. Amazon EC2 cloud services were used to construct the server, and Apache, My-SQL, and PHP were installed on the Linux operating system to create a server development environment. The client directly implemented the chat and review board functions, which were key functions in the project, targeting Android. In this way, I was able to use IT knowledge in many ways by mobilizing my major and practical experience in the development process to the extent that I was told that I had completed the project by all my team members, and I was recognized for the creativity of the idea to the extent that I was judged and asked to patent the method of using the beacon. The second reason is that through communication and consideration with the team members, we have achieved satisfactory results for all team members. Two of the team members assigned a small amount due to their lack of development experience, but I saw them having difficulties in the development process. I participated in the development of the Android client for them and gave consideration to them more than I did. After completing each one, I collected everyone's quantity for integration, but the data types did not match and each had difficulty in progressing due to their different coding styles. However, through a lot of conversations, we coordinated and focused on the parts that did not fit, and realized the confidence in collaboration and the importance of communication required in the process. As a result of this communication and consideration, we won the contest and it was an opportunity to enhance the teamwork and software development skills of all team members.""""I will quickly adapt to work at GS Neotech through my interest in and experience in the cloud through my academic and practical experience."" Working on the project to be submitted to the contest and using AWS EC2 service as an application server, I became interested in various functions of AWS and its future potential. In addition, while working at the Electronic Components Research Institute, I was able to gain interest and practical experience in the cloud by participating in research and development tasks of the Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning related to virtual desktops and clouds, using a cloud management tool called Cloud Stack, and developing some of them."" In addition, I gained a wide range of knowledge such as programming language, software engineering, network, database, and operating system through my major classes to lay the foundation for adapting to the computerized job. I developed software to participate in a competition with my classmates, and I took on the role of project manager from planning to planning, leading the team in all parts of design, database, server, and client programming, and developed a sense of responsibility and communication with team members. I believe that my experience and interest in cloud services can be of practical help in performing my duties as a member of GS Neotech, and I will grow into a cloud expert with GS Neotech based on this."",,"
"""From 0 to 100,"" I was able to take the web development capability, which had been zero, one step closer to becoming a full-stack developer through the efforts of the past year. First, I participated in the 300-hour 'JAVA Framework Practical Developer Training Course' to lay the foundation for web development. However, I had difficulty in understanding the web and developing high-quality projects for 300 hours. As a result, I challenged 'OOOOOOOOOOOOO' to make up for my lack of competency, and I had a good opportunity to receive a year of web development training. For 6 months, I learned both the front and back ends using Spring and value.js, and developed web development capabilities. In addition, I learned the Java algorithm and took the initiative in studying algorithms with my team members. Through this, I was able to develop problem-solving skills and gained the ability to share what I learned by conducting code reviews with my friends. I was able to gain practical skills by conducting team projects in the same form as in practice. The location-based travel record platform, which was born after getting the idea from Github's lawn planting, was in charge of developing the backend using JPA in SpringBoot. Since it was my first web project, I was able to experience various challenges and experiences. I was able to acquire new skills such as login using JWT token, photo management using S3, and application of HTTPS, and I was able to solve various problems during development and develop my problem-solving ability. One of them was when I was dealing with JPA, when I mapped different tables to entities, an infinite reference phenomenon occurred. This phenomenon was difficult to find the cause of the problem after the first time, but as a result of not being frustrated and referring to various technology blogs, it was caused by incorrect design. I found that the two entities were mapped in both directions, and that infinite reference occurred because the database and service were not used independently. In order to reduce the degree of coupling, the request and response DTO required for each API were separately created. Although it took a long time to modify, by creating DTO, I was able to select and send only the necessary information and solve the infinite reference phenomenon. Thanks to the spirit of challenge to acquire new skills and persistence to solve problems, I was able to successfully complete the project and receive the excellence award. As we developed the platform, we reused components as much as possible in front development, efficiently configured the UI, and simplified code and file to increase readability. When it comes to backend development, we made efforts to provide stable service by building MSA-structured server on EC2 which separated server by function. In addition, RESTful API was developed with MVC structure for future maintenance, and we improved the convenience of project distribution by automating distribution with Jenkins. In addition, we were able to learn the process of collaborating while working on multiple team projects. Through Git, we were able to learn version management of code, communication between front end and backend through Swagger, share progress with team members through Jira, and learn how to implement Agile-applied project. ""Incentives from Leading Position"" When I was an undergraduate, I worked for two years in the school's industry-academic cooperation team to solve problem with leading attitude and receive incentives. One of my tasks was to copy expenditure/income resolutions, and these documents became close to 1,000 copies a week. A lot of paper and printer toner were wasted, and the work process was not efficient because it was stored on paper. I thought it would be much more efficient to scan and manage these documents, but managing them required the introduction of a new program. Therefore, I suggested the introduction of a new program to the staff, and after discussing the issue with the team leader at a general meeting, my opinion was accepted. As a result, the cost of introducing the program was lower than the cost of purchasing paper, which saved the budget, improved the work process, and increased the efficiency of the work. The team leader also recognized my hard work and sincerity and received an incentive that was unprecedented. Through this experience, I am responsible for my work, do my best, and have an active attitude. With this attitude, I will become a leading new employee who constantly thinks about a better direction in Kakao.""???,,,"
"""Talent who keeps running"" If I were to describe myself in one word, I would consider myself a ""marathon."" This is because, over the past year and a half, I have built up my web development capabilities with two training sessions and three web projects, and I will continue to build up my capabilities. As a graduation project during my undergraduate years, I developed a sign language translator using Java, and I became attracted to object-oriented programming, and while looking for Java-based development methodology, I became interested in web development. Therefore, I participated in the 300-hour 'JAVA Framework Practical Developer Training Course' to lay the foundation for web development. However, I had difficulty in understanding the web and developing high-quality projects for 300 hours. As a result, I was able to challenge 'OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO' to make up for my lack of competency, and I had a great opportunity to receive a year of web development training. For six months, I developed my web development capabilities by learning both the front and back ends using Spring and value.js. After receiving the training, we conducted a recipe recommendation project that considers the user's preference by using a travel record platform project based on user location information and big data, and we were able to present outstanding prizes at both project presentations. Through this project, we were able to develop our full stack development capabilities by participating in both the backend and the frontend. When it comes to front-end development, we reused components as much as possible, efficiently configured the UI, and simplified code and file to increase readability. When it comes to back-end development, we built a service with MSA structure that separated servers by function on AWS to build a stable service, developed an efficient RESTful API with MVC structure, and improved the convenience of project distribution by automating distribution with Jenkins. As I have been working hard on one path, I am confident that I am a talented person who will continue to develop and develop from now on.""""3rd Excellence Award""3rd Project""I gained web development capability by experiencing 3 projects in OO""OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO. We worked on 3 projects to build a cloud-based web using EC2 and built a server mainly in charge of the backend. I will introduce two of them. First, the project called Commitment is a travel history web service that was born with the idea from Github's lawn planting. Taking charge of the backend, we built a DB using Mariadb and produced various RESTful APIs using SpringBoot. First, we needed the user's location permission to record the trip. However, we realized that location permission was only available in the https environment, and we newly learned that https was required to support security and various services. Therefore, we received SSL certificates and distributed them at https, contributing to the smooth progress of the project. In addition, we were able to grow the most by challenging various technologies such as firebase and S3, and we had the ability to learn and apply new things with the mind of developing developers. Second, Recook was a personalized recipe recommendation service that analyzed users' tastes using big data. His role was to implement recipe recommendation API based on content-based filtering using recipe crawling using python and Django. However, due to the large amount of data, there was a problem that it took about 10 seconds to execute the recommended algorithm. Therefore, we divided the table to optimize the query's performance, and we were able to reduce the time from 10 seconds to 3 seconds. Although the time was shortened, it was regrettable that more time would have been saved if semi-normalization was performed or redis was applied to reduce repetitive join in the initial DB design. As such, I have built up the ability to think about the performance of better projects and to create optimal efficiency.""""CS Study"" I think the most lacking competency at the moment is CS knowledge. I have built up some JAVA programming ability and capability in algorithms through continuous algorithm studies for a year, but I felt that I lacked knowledge of really basic CS. Therefore, a study was formed to gain CS basic knowledge, and the study was conducted every day and a topic of the field each other wanted was selected and presented. The presentation materials were organized in the Notion and organized by subject so that the study members could see it easily. There was a huge difference between knowing the acquired knowledge to yourself and explaining it to others. In order to explain to others, I had to understand the deep content, and when a question came in to the study members, I had to study even matters related to the subject to answer it. Therefore, I was able to make the knowledge gained through the presentation more mine. Even after doing the study, I have time to review every day to familiarize myself with the presentation of other team members, and I am trying to understand exactly what I presented. I will continue to do CS studies and build basic competencies for development. ""'Actual Service' I have worked on three web projects, but I think I still lack web development capabilities. This is because I felt that I lacked the ability to respond to problems that occurred when I actually performed the service because I had not conducted the actual service. To cultivate this, we are continuously maintaining the project and preparing to perform the actual service. I have received 32 feedback from 82 users, and I am trying to improve the shortcomings of the project based on the feedback. We also used Redis to align our data to scale out our servers in the future. We will continue to maintain, build practical capabilities, and build problem response capabilities."""
"In the programming language/A0/1st grade, I took the C language class for the first time and proceeded with a project to create a game. It was difficult to create a game, but the sense of accomplishment gained by completing the functions one by one made me interested in programming. Object-oriented language/B0/When I took the class, I didn't fully understand the C language, so I felt unfamiliar with object-oriented language. However, as I developed a sign language translator using Java as a graduation project in the fourth grade, I became attracted to object-oriented programming, and while looking for a Java-based development methodology, I became interested in web development. It was a class that allowed me to understand the concepts of database/A0/object, relationship, and attribute. Based on the understood concepts, I was able to understand one-to-one, many-to-many, and many-to-many relationships between objects and learn how to draw ERD. In addition, I was able to CRUD DB data using SQL, understand INNER JOIN, LEFT/RIGHT OUTER JOIN, and write Query. I was able to learn about the design and implementation methods of various data structures for data structures/B+/array stack queue trees and graphs. It was a class that could have a solid foundation by learning examples of algorithms to see what kind of situations these data structures could be applied to. Algorithm Analysis/A+/ Through the class, I was able to understand algorithmic notation, alignment, search, and graphs. I learned how to select an efficient algorithm to solve problems according to situations using various data structures. I have experience in creating a recipe recommendation platform based on user taste using big data ""Shortening from 10 seconds to 3 seconds"". I was in charge of implementing the function to recommend related recipes using content-based filtering in Django. Using Python, we imported more than 5,000 recipe data through crawling and processed more than 70,000 review data. We succeeded in implementing the function of recommending recipes with similar ingredients using content-based filtering, but a problem occurred. It took about 10 seconds to receive the data, and it was inconvenient to use the service. To determine the cause, we ran the code line by line and conducted the test. As a result, the reason why it took a long time to receive the data was in query. When there were 70,000 review data, it was the main cause of the performance degradation, and when five tables were joined at once, query's performance dropped sharply. Therefore, the review table and the recipe-hashtag-material-material-material name four tables were joined and imported separately, and only the columns were required. The API, which took 10 seconds to receive the data, was reduced to 3 seconds. Although the time was shortened, it was regrettable that if semi-normalization had been performed to reduce repetitive join in the initial DB design, it would have saved a little more time. As a result, the project was successfully completed, and I realized the importance of meticulous design even if it took time. ""Why we need to distinguish between the entity and the DTO,"" I have experience in contributing to the award of excellence at the SSAFY Common Project Competition by developing the backend of the travel platform production project with constant challenge spirit and persistence. I was in charge of the backend based on SpringBoot, and I decided to apply JPA that I had never learned before. Of course, I was used to using MyBatis, but JPA is known to be excellent in performance, productivity, and maintenance, so I tried to learn a new technology by applying JPA. However, I was not familiar with JPA, so there was a problem during development. After mapping different tables to the entity, an error occurred after going around an infinite loop. In addition, in the response, unnecessary data was provided, resulting in an increase in the amount of response data. I belatedly learned that this problem is caused by not generating the entity and the DTO separately. I realized that DTO is a class for View used by Request/Response, and since it needs to be changed frequently, it is appropriate to create it separately. To solve this problem, I created DTO separately and used the BeanUtils.copyProperties method to convert it from entity to DTO. It took a long time to modify everything, but I realized the necessity of DTO and that DTO served as a designer. Thanks to the spirit of challenge to acquire new skills and persistence to solve problems, I was able to successfully complete the project and win the Excellence Award."",,,,"
