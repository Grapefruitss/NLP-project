"As I like the public interest orientation, I am applying for jobs at public corporations and public institutions. When I saw the job advertisement of the Korea Broadcasting Corporation, I remembered the phrase KBS is a broadcasting station in charge of disaster broadcasting that I saw on TV one day. As a broadcasting company in charge of disaster and a government-funded company, I felt the responsibility of the Korea Broadcasting Corporation to set an example for other broadcasting stations was attractive to me. I will be a talented person who supports from behind and builds a computer broadcasting system that attracts attention from around the world. After joining the company, I plan to go to the graduate school of engineering, psychology, and language. I will become an employee who develops KBS with new skills and knowledge as a person who sees the world widely, and enhances the power of information provision given by broadcasting to a developing country. I have a broad spectrum of knowledge encompassing engineering and humanities. I took 91 credits in electronic and information and communication engineering. This is the result of my previous career as a senior and wanting to learn more about SW. I learned digital & analog circuits, semiconductor design, computer structure, hardware design, low-level words (machine language, C language) in the electronics department, and I learned OS, data structure, advanced language (java), network, communication, and digital media in the communications department. When I had time, I worked on projects such as IoT solutions and video processing. I also gained experience in participating in competitions with undergraduate researchers. In addition, I collaborated with other majors and gained various knowledge by participating in graduation works of SW and Machine department for one year each. In addition, I run the server at home for personal information protection and convenience. I faced numerous errors and problems during operation, and I was able to gain a lot of practical experience by solving them. In terms of humanities, I dug into the language analytically through my double major in English literature, and learned the culture that determines the characteristics and changes from the beginning of the language together. I learned Anglo-American culture, English composition, phonology, syntax, pedagogy, special purpose English (ESP), and interpretation. And I am learning Russian because I became interested in Eastern Europe. Communication and cooperation - Even a strong group had the disadvantage of working alone without teamwork and liking the shortcomings of others in my early 20s. While serving as the team leader in the first grade project, the uncooperative team members criticized and acted arbitrarily, and in the end, the other team members and I, who showed the best performance in our class, got the lowest score in the project despite our outstanding capabilities and grades. Through this crushing defeat, I realized that teamwork is as important as competence. There were several failures until I acknowledged that they were not identical to each other and learned that the best results were achieved in a single team based on each other's strengths. Based on this, I supplemented my shortcomings and utilized my strengths. Furthermore, I assisted and led the team in accordance with my position. In particular, when I participated in graduation work in other departments, I recognized and applied for work that team members needed. In addition, whenever I was the team leader, I identified the strengths of my team members and divided tasks, and systematized the progress of program development by fully utilizing my organizational and planned personality. This Old Tony, youtube.com/user/featony I have been very interested in the principles of how things work and applied science and technology. When I was in middle and high school, I aimed to enter the physics department, and I took classes and learned similar engineering as a major. The contents I enjoy were also greatly influenced by this tendency, and I enjoy watching videos related to mechanical engineering that I do not know well. Among them, I have been watching Tony's channel, which mainly deals with metal processing and processing machines, from the beginning. The principles and techniques explained in detail so that even beginners can easily understand them give intellectual stimulation and engineering inspiration, and the occasional Dad joke, also called 'Ajae Gag', gives me pleasure. In addition, sensationality and verbal violence, which are disadvantages of the high proportion of UCCs in the current trend, are rarely present in this Old Tony channel. For this reason, Tony's channel has become the channel I enjoy most, beating other channels (such as VanossGaming). IT technology can be applied to disaster broadcasting in the contents of the 2019 OOOOO Fall Conference. In the event of a disaster, it is not only the automatic caption generation, but the video editing pattern can be programmed or learned to produce the transmitted video. By learning the transmission video for each situation in advance, such as disasters, social disasters, and civil defense incidents, it can be processed appropriately for each situation. Once the video is completed automatically to a certain extent, the person in charge will quickly correct and send it to you, enabling efficient business processing in an urgent situation. This technology can be used not only for disasters but also for producing general programs. It can be an excellent auxiliary tool for video production by removing time criticality elements and adding various options. By analyzing the type of video, channel, and related data, it is possible to shorten the insertion time of related data, music, and effects by recommending them in real time during editing. In addition, voice recognition can identify the contents of the original video and edit it and recommend changing the order. You can increase the accuracy rate by giving feedback on whether to select a recommendation, and if a certain level of accuracy rate is completed, you will be able to advance to a semi-automatic video production system."
"I applied to Samsung SDS because I wanted to create a customized platform by creating an AI-based platform. I think the important thing in the rapidly changing Fourth Industrial Revolution is to provide new advanced services and differentiated solutions that meet the needs of customers. Samsung SDS has increased the convenience of logistics management by developing its own AI-based integrated logistics management platform Cello, and is securing competitiveness by building a platform that provides customized content based on customers by incorporating AI into retail stores. Therefore, I thought that Samsung SDS, which provides optimal IT services and gives convenience to customers, would provide industry-class advanced services in the future. My goal is to build an AI-based platform and provide new customer experiences at these Samsung SDS. Therefore, I built up my AI capabilities by creating a sign language translator using machine learning to achieve this goal. First, the model was learned and the predictive model was provided by incorporating SVM machine learning, and the predictive accuracy was increased by learning several times to reduce the error of the predictive model. Through this process, I gained knowledge and experience in the field of AI, and became more interested in AI. Based on this experience, Samsung SDS will build a platform that incorporates AI to increase customer satisfaction and contribute to the growth of the company. ""Incentive from Leading Position"" After working for two years in the OO Cooperation Team of the school, I have an attitude to actively solve problems. One of my tasks was to copy the spending/income resolution, and these documents became close to 1,000 pages a week. I thought this part was less efficient. The reason was not only the waste of paper, but also the warehouse where documents were stored was small, and if documents were needed, they had to be found in many documents, so I felt that it was not appropriate for the digital age. So I thought that these problems could be solved by scanning and managing the data. Because I saved toner on paper and print, I saved the budget and reduced the effort for employees to find documents. So I suggested to the accounting staff about scanning and managing the data. The employees also felt uncomfortable, so I discussed the issue with the team leader through a meeting, and my opinion came to be accepted. I had to introduce a new program to change the work process, but the cost of introducing the program was much lower, which saved the OO team's budget. In addition, I improved the work process and increased the efficiency of my work. The team leader also recognized my hard work and sincerity, and I was able to receive unprecedented incentives. Through this experience, I have become responsible for my duties, do my best, and have an active attitude. With this attitude, I will become a leading new employee who strives to improve the problem at Samsung SDS. ""From 0 to 100,"" I was able to become a full stack developer through the efforts of the past year. Developing a sign language translator using JAVA made me attracted to object-oriented programming, and while looking for a JAVA-based development methodology, I became interested in web development. Therefore, I participated in the 300-hour 'JAVA OOO practical developer training course' and built the foundation for web development by learning JAVA, ORACLE, SPRING, JAVASCRIPT, HTML, and CSS. Since then, I have been working on a project to build a CAFE POS system based on the MVC structure, and I was able to understand the MVC construction procedure and structure while taking charge of the implementation part of the ordering system function. However, I had difficulty in understanding the web and developing a high-quality project for 300 hours. As a result, I challenged the Samsung Youth SW Academy organized by Samsung Electronics to fill in my lack of competency, and I got a good opportunity to receive a year of web development training. For 6 months, I was trained in the backend using Spring and the front end using Vue.js, and developed my competence as a full stack developer. After receiving the training, I worked on the high-quality real estate platform project and the travel record platform project, and I was able to receive the second prize at the project presentation. With these built-up capabilities, Samsung SDS will develop a platform that is convenient for customers. ""Securing customers through retail tech"" The social issue I am interested in recently is retail tech. Due to the recent COVID-19 incident, the distribution industry is changing to a smart distribution environment at a faster pace as it triggers the untact business. As a result, domestic and foreign advanced distribution companies are taking the lead in introducing technologies based on the Fourth Industrial Revolution, such as AI, big data, and robots to build product tracking, customized services based on big data, and unmanned shopping, and so on, so-called retail technology is emerging. Through Nexshop solutions, Samsung SDS is also enhancing the productivity of its sales staff by providing customized marketing and streamlining store business processes. Now that contact is in our lives, I thought that retailers would come to prefer this retail technology, and that customers would also expect to gain more and more new customer experiences. Therefore, I thought about how to attract customers through retail technology. First of all, when I thought of the inconveniences when purchasing a product, the customer information I had in each distribution channel was different, and the flow of shopping was cut off. I had to log in separately, and the items I was interested in were also different for each site, so I had to get recommendations for products I didn't want. Therefore, I thought it would be great if there was a platform that allowed me to receive product information from all distribution channels, enable payment, delivery, and even product recommendations. Of course, producing such a platform requires a lot of data, so I think it will be necessary to cooperate with other companies first.However, I believed that providing a seamless shopping experience between distribution channels would make it easier for consumers to shop and enable customers to continue purchasing through their platforms. I believe it is time to create a customer-centric business environment rather than an era in which businesses unilaterally provide information to customers."
"I think IBK System is a company that is always striving to respond to changing technologies centered on customers. I applied because I thought that this customer-centered tendency and my tendency to improve and strive without being complacent with reality fit well. During my internship for about 4 months, I have experienced that the part that I thought about and developed from a customer's perspective worked successfully. The company where I interned was a chatbot-type artificial intelligence service development company, and it was a company that used Java and Node.js. Executives were asked to develop a chatbot that could be shown there when they had to go on a business trip to the fair. At first, since it was based on an interactive format, it was made without any image insertion, but it was suggested to first-time users that guidelines might be needed, and I added images and categories so that users could click on the information they were curious about. It was a small part, but this part worked positively for users, and it was an opportunity to let them know about the company once more at the fair. I am also trying to improve myself by applying for an internship and having a project experience for about six months through an educational program, and I applied because I want to become a talented person who can contribute to the IBK system by using my abilities. The value of my personal life is ""Let's be helpful in every position."" I memorized and wanted to make sure that I understood what I learned in my class when I was in school. So, while studying with my classmates, I studied by becoming a teacher and explaining to each other again, grasping what was lacking and filling in the gaps. I wanted to make them understand more easily than I was a teacher, so I thought more and worked hard to find my own explanation method. In the process, my friends said that I explained in a more understandable way than you, and one of my friends said that my math grades especially improved thanks to me. At first, I started to fill in my individual shortcomings, but I gradually became proud to be a person who was helpful to someone. And there was something that I learned about new parts while being helpful to someone. Since then, my abilities have been used to form values to become a person who can contribute and help in any organization. These values have always made me a person who strives to improve my abilities because I don't want to be a person who can't solve a question or help me when someone asks me. I once had a colleague who was very busy in my work life. I was so busy that I helped him with his work for about a month. While helping, there was a column that was dynamically drawn at the front end, and there was a problem with the data not fitting well. Before that, I was trying to implement it by myself by processing and throwing data at the white end, not at the front end, but at the white end, that problem just happened, and I told you how I studied. So I have experience in which my method was used and solved. No one knows how to help me, but I was proud that my method was used and helped. In the training program of the recruitment-linked Java Full Stack course conducted by the company for six months, one of the team members knew that he was outstanding and ignored the opinions of other team members in the progress of the project based on react and java, so I had a difficult experience during the project. This educational program was developed by four people choosing a theme for the remaining three months after conducting both theoretical and practical training at the same time. During the full-fledged development, one team member was very confident in his development skills and had a tendency to ignore others. In particular, I made a lot of remarks that ignored me, taking the fact that I was the youngest as a weakness, and the project proceeded in a way that the team member decided on all of our work. Other team members tried to passively follow me with the idea of ""Because I'm good,"" and I thought the situation was very unfair. At that time, I had to set the path of the page passing from the front, but I was doing it as a react, and it was not easy to deal with the router because it was my first time using it, and it was difficult to contain parameters, and the difference between using the router in the main and sub parts was difficult. The team member was also having a hard time, and he said he would do it within a week, but he said he would do it, and I bought and read a book called ""Technology to deal with react"", searched for how to use the router, made examples into a project, and studied them, and incorporated them into the project to set a path framework. The team member was excellent, but he lacked sincerity, and in the end, I was able to set the framework first and accelerate our project schedule. The team member acknowledged my sincerity and effort and was sorry, and after that, I was able to proceed with the project by accepting the opinions of other team members. I was able to learn that skills are important, but that much sincerity and effort can catch up with them. I was told by the professor that my programming skills were very poor, so I was not good enough. After hearing that, I tried to improve my skills, and I had an experience that I was told that I had worked hard and changed a lot in the next professor's class. In my second year at university, the professor in the business science class asked me to implement the clustering algorithm myself and prepare a presentation for anyone who wanted to present the code. At that time, I was taking another liberal arts class, a programming class, thinking about how to solve the problem, and the joy when the expected value came out when the expected value did not come out, and I was having pure fun in the process of debugging the problem where it was even if the expected value did not come out.As a result of the class, I became interested in programming and had fun, and I decided to do the presentation. Since I had only studied the basic C language, I felt that I was very lacking in implementing logic, and in the end, I was criticized by the professor that it was a very poor presentation and that I think I was not good at it. So, I joined the programming club in our department to improve my skills. The club was an academic club in which they decided on one or two questions in consideration of the difficulty level at programmers sites using the JAVA language, and the next time they met, they shared and reviewed the solutions. At first, I tried to make it my own way by listening to other people's solving methods, and gradually improved my skills by holding on to the problem three times a week, two hours a week. After that, in my fourth year of university, I took an algorithm class by the same professor. The class was also a presentation-type class, so I showed my improved skills by implementing and presenting a new algorithm, and the professor said that my skills seem to have improved more than before, and I got good grades. As an IT technology that will lead the change in finance, I think it is 'AI'. Due to COVID-19, non-face-to-face financial transactions are spreading, and a new type of bank called the non-face-to-face digital banking service Neobank is currently emerging. In addition, big tech companies, which are IT giants that have begun to provide financial services in the era of digital transformation, are emerging. This poses a threat to existing banks as it may lose young customers in their 20s and 30s who are familiar with the new technology. So, existing banks have to make an effort to provide differentiated services, and I think one of these differentiated services is AI. There are a total of four positive impacts that the introduction of AI will have on financial services. First, through work automation, cost can be reduced and efficiency can be improved. Second, customized services are possible by identifying customer needs. Third, products and services can be provided anytime, anywhere according to customer preferences. Fourth, the introduction of AI can provide convenience to the marginalized elderly. Due to these effects, I think AI is a key IT technology. I was interested in big data when I was in college, so I thought I needed the ability to collect and analyze data in order to acquire these technologies. So, when I was in college, I took a data science course and took data analysis methods and data preprocessing using Python. In addition, my internship grew interest in AI while working for about four months at a company that developed a chatbot using Googel Assistant. And in order to increase the development ability amid the rapid increase in the use of web services and mobile due to non-representative financial transactions, the company is currently developing web services based on Spring Boot, along with a six-month Java Full Stack curriculum, so we are trying to equip ourselves with technology in line with the era of digital transformation."
"I had the experience of taking an English presentation class when I was in fourth grade. I hated the personality of not being able to speak well in front of people, so I took the class to practice English presentations in front of people before going out into society. I messed up the first presentation because I was nervous. After class was over, the professor said that I was originally more nervous than I was, and that practice was the only way to live. I started practicing in front of the mirror as I learned from the professor, and I was speechless imagining myself standing in front of people, but I kept practicing until the tension subsided. As a result of practicing several times, I was able to successfully complete the final presentation, and the evaluation table the professor gave me with a smile marked perfect score for all items. Like this experience of overcoming shortcomings, I have been putting top priority on a growing life and am aiming for the following life. The first is a life of harmony with people. Just as meeting the professor led me in a better direction, I believe that because of the people around me, I was able to grow in a good direction and that the present me exists. The second is a life of challenge. In order to grow up, I need opportunities such as 'presentation classes', so I have tried to use them as a stepping stone to make a leap forward by challenging various internal and external activities. I have a habit of not only being meticulous in my work and assignments, but also keeping everything on record. As an intern, the habit of taking notes was really helpful. By keeping records of the priorities of the job and why I had to do it, I was able to see clearly. However, meticulousness sometimes served as a drawback. Considering the position of the viewer, I tried to make the font, line spacing, and visual parts as well as possible, so I spent a lot of time submitting them. However, my senior official complimented me for writing the report neatly and in a viewer's perspective. I think these shortcomings can be overcome by adapting to work. ""Diverse experiences that began as an infrastructure engineer intern"" I had working at an IT infrastructure company. This was because while I was an intern, I was able to experience many things that I could not learn at school, academy, or on the Internet and learn them while working on projects. While managing the entire division's infrastructure as a military computer soldier, I tried to become an infrastructure engineer according to my aptitude, and as a result, I interned at 00, an infrastructure construction company. During my internship training, I took Linux & Aix, VMware, X_86, and storage training, and participated in practical training and projects. I visited various customer IDC and worked on rack installation, server mount and OS setting, RAID configuration, and redundancy tests, and the most impressive work was the installation experience of a total of 35 Dell servers in their IDC. During the initial installation stage, I learned the rack and HW structure. During the OS setting stage, I installed Linux and VMware vsphere and applied it directly to real servers rather than PCs, learned the practical sense, and also saw the SAN structure between servers, network equipment, and storage. Finally, during the redundancy test, I was able to check that the tasks I had done so far were actually well configured for redundancy. Also, during my internship, I was curious about how the cloud served in an on-premises environment is actually used, so I made 3tire, the basic structure of the web, while studying AWS. In the DMZ section, an ELB load-level and autoscaling group were set up to consider the increase in traffic, and a web server was set up with nginx. In addition, LB was set as an internal network so that the WAS area could not be accessed from outside. In order to access the WAS area, proxy_pass was set in the nginx of the DMZ zone to communicate with the internal LB. With just a click, I could feel the power of the cloud by watching the mail service according to complex settings and situations. Through the internship experience, I was able to learn the large composition of the infrastructure and even experience cloud construction. ""Ways for efficient team work in good faith competition."" The final project of the OOO program was a time to think about various problems and solutions. Organized by OOO, the 'Public OOO Youth Internship' program selects a total of 120 people and gives only 1 million interns in order of grades. For this reason, competition in good faith among the selected students was important, and the most important thing was to harmonize the team in the final project with the highest percentage of grades. All of the ""Selection of Clear Purpose"" wanted to become an intern at a public institution that wanted to go with high grades, so everyone was full of motivation. In this situation, it was important for all team members to coordinate their differences, recognize the direction and goal of the subject, and start. Due to the tight time, we proceeded by setting only the direction rather than the exact subject, and the more we proceeded, the more confused the purpose of the project was, and the more we thought differently. As repeated meetings continued, I suggested expressing our thoughts using a whiteboard. Previously, it seemed like catching a floating cloud because I only explained it in words, but by using a whiteboard, I was able to get my purpose right. I also learned the importance of sharing the work progress of team members. Each day was important because I had to finish the project in a short time. That's why I had to spend the day efficiently, and for this, it was important for everyone to recognize what each team member was doing and why. This is because team members can tell me whether the direction was right or wrong. So every day, I had a short time to share what to do today, what to do tomorrow, and what wasn't going well, within 15 minutes. By communicating only the key elements briefly every day, our group was able to proceed efficiently in a short period of time. ""Creative challenging spirit"" When I overcame my own shortcomings, I also studied fields such as infrastructure, cloud, and big data, not just development students when I graduated from school. I always lived a life of ""creatively challenging.""I think this is similar to Webzen's vision and the reason for its success. In the past, Webzen found a new breakthrough overseas by transferring part of its game IP, such as graphics, trademark, character, and distribution, beyond the way it used to earn royalties by selling publishing rights. I wanted to be with Webzen as I watched them succeed by seeking domestic and international expansion in various ways without being complacent about the way others did and always did. While preparing for the application this time, I found that it created a software education classroom for local youth, operated coding and software education programs, and provided young people with opportunities to experience various software activities. In the past, I was able to grow by receiving free 100 hours of Java education at school and free education in the field of data analysis at the Korea Data Promotion Agency. I want to contribute my abilities to society by sharing the benefits I received in the past with Webzen. Webzen is Korea's leading game company and offers a variety of games. Although there are still shortcomings, I will lead a large-scale infrastructure stably and successfully based on the experience of computer diseases and the experience of the cloud I learned while interning."
"""Aiming to the Experts of Vision AI"" Lotte Information and Communication is striving to improve customer satisfaction and the company by researching AI and applying it to various domains in line with the era of the 4th Industrial Revolution. We supported Lotte Information and Communication by seeing the infinite growth potential of the company, which is becoming a leading company of DT based on its outstanding technological prowess. Vision AI technology using deep learning and computer vision is a field of excellent application that can provide various services to products. When I was an undergraduate, I was interested in Vision AI when I heard the news of the emergence of ResNet, which transcends the recognition rate of human sight. In the future IT era, which is more advanced than the present, I want to be a person who leads innovative social values through independent implementation, not just using these technologies. During my studies, I gained my skills mainly through industry-academic research and competition projects using computer vision algorithms such as object detection/recognition/tracking. Even during the period when there was no industry-academic research, I learned practical knowledge by working as a freelance developer at a company that was introduced by the professor for constant self-development. Thanks to various experiences, I have developed the ability to logically approach the attitude of project collaboration and image processing issues and implement the platform through basic technology. Based on my accumulated capabilities, I always want to pay attention to the latest Vision AI technology, cope with the rapidly changing environment, and find issues that need improvement to contribute to performance improvement and optimization. I will become an expert who leads the design and implementation of Vision AI's solutions by becoming the subject of the development flow. ""AI modeling competency"" I think the ability to create high-performance AI models is the most important in the Vision AI job. I developed my AI modeling ability by participating in a competition to compete for model ranking on a real-time ranking board. I set a goal of winning the top three prize in the competition and challenged the image classification category. In the preliminary round, I barely advanced to the finals with a low-ranking performance due to a mistake in misdirection of model design and implementation. However, I didn't give up and took the last mistake as an opportunity to continue the challenge. In the finals, we found the issue that the given dataset was perfect through thorough analysis and designed it to solve it. By applying oversampling to model learning, the data imbalance was alleviated and the generalization of noise data was suppressed by applying Label Smoothing loss. Since then, we have built a completely refined dataset by using self-training to Pseudo labeling noise data. As an additional performance improvement strategy, we found and applied an augmentation method suitable for the dataset and created an Ensemble model that has undergone various hyperparameter tuning. We won second place in the competition by creating a model that improved the first baseline F1-score from 0.46 to 0.87. We have acquired several technical capabilities for improving AI modeling performance and gained confidence in development. Even when performing our duties, we are confident in implementing solutions that quickly find and solve image recognition development issues and produce optimal performance. ""Efforts for active sociality"" We had a weakness of the lack of sociality due to our introverted personality. We felt the need for change because we thought that insufficient sociality was the worst attitude as a developer who grows through collaboration and sharing information. I engaged in a total of three activities and tried to become a person with active social skills. First, I participated in as many practical assistance activities as possible, and conducted Q&A and troubleshooting about the code. I was able to increase my network by talking to many people, and I developed my conversation ability to communicate knowledge efficiently to listeners. Second, I participated in several contests and developed my ability to collaborate with my team members. Even if there were problems in other work parts, I communicated together, found the cause, helped each other, and cooperated organically. I was able to gain confidence in collaboration by succeeding in the project based on teamwork. Finally, when development was completed, I always wrote a thesis based on the implementation and presented it at an academic conference. It was a good time to think about other approaches to implementation or ways to improve performance by exchanging opinions with the audience on the contents of the presentation. Based on the knowledge I shared with many people, I was able to grow one step further by grasping the latest research trends. As a result of consistently practicing the three activities, I felt that I was growing as a developer by actively communicating with people. We will continue to actively respond to new technologies and maintain active social skills so that we can become AI developers who grow with our teams. ""Challenging spirit to overcome difficulties"" When I was a 4th grader, I carried out a team project aimed at winning the nation's largest ICT contest. It was a difficult goal because about 430 teams participated and only 16 teams won the main prize, but I challenged with the will to do anything. Prior to the submission of the contest, I first received an interim evaluation as an on-campus capstone design project. Contrary to expectations, the project did not produce any clear results and received the worst score of being the last place on campus. I was frustrated with the thought that the project I had been preparing had failed, and I was afraid that I would not be able to meet the graduation conditions, let alone link to the contest. In particular, I felt more distressed because I felt responsible for not being able to lead the project properly as a team leader. However, when I came in last anyway, I felt that I had no reason to fear failure anymore, and I decided to use this failure as an opportunity to recover from my mistakes. With the determination to risk everything, I focused on development by reducing sleep time. The project direction was partially changed, and the technologies required for implementation were collected and implemented in stages. When I needed more professional opinions, I listened to various professors and working-level officials to find improvements. As the saying goes, ""Efforts do not betray,"" I won the main prize that I aimed for, ranking 7th out of 430 teams in the competition, and I received a silver prize at an academic conference for my thesis based on the implementation.It was the best experience for me to achieve my goals by relentlessly challenging and not giving up on failures. ""Holding skills and utilization"" Python ? 5, Java ? 4, Android-3, Tensorflow ? 5, Pytorch ?4, Caffe-3, Linux ? 4 ""Lightening for optimum performance and processing speed."" Lightening is the technology field that I'm most interested in right now. In the embedded software-based project during my master's degree, limited computing power or memory and power have always been a problem. To solve this problem, we compared and studied lightweight deep learning algorithms with algorithmic lightweight technology, and sought a system that uses technology with appropriate performance to perform high performance and fast inference with little memory. It is regrettable that we couldn't do more research because we came across lightweight technologies near the master's degree. We also want to study optimization for trade-off, which reduces performance as we pursue higher lightweighting steps. Considering the future trend of increasing the use of IoT and mobile devices, it is expected that the provision of services using deep learning technology will gradually expand in small devices. Therefore, I think light weight is a technology that must be accompanied in order to provide deep learning services even in environments with limited resources. If I join the company, I would like to work on research and development with light weight so that I can provide optimized services in various environments as well as develop deep learning solutions for providing services."
"""Implementing the core technologies of domain-specific mobile objects"" Hyundai AutoEver AI job is developing mobility technologies not only for automobiles but also for domain-specific mobile objects such as drones and AGVs. In particular, it is focusing on the implementation of image recognition-based positioning technology and situation understanding technology to construct autonomous driving algorithms for domain-specific mobile objects. In the case of automobiles or indoor mobile robots driving in tunnels, GPS use is limited, making it difficult to locate them in real time. In order to solve this problem, Visual Localization/Odometry, which is a positioning and mapping technology using feature points of an image, and Object Recognition/Tracking technology for context understanding are essential. Domain-specific mobile objects are implemented based on embedded systems that are gradually becoming ultra-small. As they become smaller, relatively scarce resources must be used efficiently, so optimization must be accompanied based on the overall understanding of embedded systems. Therefore, it is judged that offloading technology for the use of minimal networks and deep compression technology to reduce the burden of using deep learning models in low-power devices are additionally needed. I believe that video comprehension technology, which is applicable to the overall domain-specific mobile object, embodies the core of mobility automation and has infinite potential for development that can bring about a new paradigm of the Fourth Industrial Revolution by combining it with other advanced technologies. ""Creativity in Thinking of Efficient Methods"" As a strength, I have the creativity to constantly think about issues that need to be improved and to come up with effective methods. I have experience in increasing development efficiency by using my creativity when participating in projects of external companies as freelancers while studying for my master's degree. We have developed a deep learning-based real-time license plate recognition project that can respond to external matters such as changes in the brightness of the place or illumination. It was discussed that the learning data should be based on the image of a license plate taken directly on the road during the project order phase, but I thought that the method was inefficient. To improve this, we proposed and approved a crawler implementation that automatically extracts images searched on the web. This has made it possible to secure data without having to go outside. However, the crawler method also found the disadvantage of manually extracting the license plate text data in the acquired image and felt the need to improve it further. For a more efficient way, I have come up with a way to use the license plate recognition system in implementation for data collection purposes. We have implemented a system that recognizes the license plate number passing by from the RTSP image of the road CCTV and uses the classified license plate text as learning image data through the segmentation process. Automating to efficiently collect learning data allowed us to focus on implementing key algorithms and successfully terminate the project on the completion date. We will contribute to the development of artificial intelligence with our creativity to constantly think about problems and improve the efficiency of projects. During my studies, I have carried out various projects by utilizing Object Localization/Recognition/Tracking to acquire expertise in deep learning and computer vision technology. When I was an undergraduate of ""Aggravated Reality RC Car Using Raspberry Pi"", I developed an RC car of VR augmented reality game contents that sets driving records on model roads by linking Capstone design and OOO ICT competitions. We implemented computer vision rule-based Object Localization/Recognition and other backend algorithms on embedded hardware that recognize signs, traffic lights, driving lanes, etc. on the road. It became an opportunity to faithfully learn the basic knowledge of traditional computer vision. In a contest in which more than 430 teams participated, they entered the top 10 and received a bronze award, and they published a paper at an academic conference and received a silver award. ""Autoprogramming for Web Applications"" With the support of OOOOOO, we researched technologies related to intelligent automatic programming and developed an automatic creation platform for web applications based on sketch images. We implemented an algorithm that detects the layout of sketch images and web objects by using computer vision and deep learning-based Object Localization/Recognition and automatically generates HTML codes that match classified results. It was a good experience to proactively develop the overall deep learning platform backend, which was in charge of designing deep learning networks to collecting and preprocessing learning data. It succeeded in TTA certification and patent registration with the content of automatically generating code using computer vision-based heuristic method and deep learning image recognition, and published a KCI paper after receiving the Best Paper Award at an academic conference. ""Porting Vehicle License Plate Recognition Algorithm on SoC Board"" He worked as a freelance developer at Truen, a video device manufacturer, and developed a license plate OCR system. Regarding the text recognition of vehicle license plate, we focused on the internalization of technology that can be operated on lightweight embedded boards and can respond to external matters of real-time recognition. Object recognition/Tracking was implemented for OCR for license plate text in real-time video. Lightweight deep learning algorithms with few computations and efficient structure were used for the use of low-power embedded boards. The pre-stage development was successfully completed and the contract was extended to industry-academic research within the school for maintenance. Based on the implementation, he published it as a KCI paper. I was interested in artificial intelligence when I heard the news of the emergence of ResNet, which showed a 96.4% recognition rate exceeding the 94.9% recognition rate of human vision when I was an undergraduate ""to become the subject of the development flow."" In particular, image-based artificial intelligence using deep learning and computer vision is a key field that combines mobility to create synergy and become a leading technology for autonomous driving. I want to be the subject of the development flow that provides innovative mobility services and solution design to both customers and companies by utilizing image-based artificial intelligence.Through this, when the advanced future IT era arrives, I will not simply be a user who receives services, but a person who leads social values through independent implementation. As part of my efforts to become the subject of the development flow, I have steadily conducted industry-academic research and contests, and through communication with the team, I have developed an attitude of collaboration to coordinate opinions and improve projects in a better direction. In addition, I have developed my expertise by actively utilizing and developing the knowledge I understand after reading and developing artificial intelligence and embedded papers necessary for my job, as well as writing papers based on the implementation contents. Thanks to my experience in various projects, I have developed the ability to logically approach AI development issues and implement platforms through underlying technologies. Even after joining the company, I will become the subject of the development flow and become an expert who leads the mobility service using artificial intelligence-based video understanding that will be commercialized in the future."
"The biggest reason for applying to Woori Bank is that it is a company that actively promotes digital innovation by conducting digital transformation. With the advent of the era of untact due to COVID-19, the bank's business is changing more rapidly, centering on fintech. Woori Bank is preparing to follow this trend by hiring 100% of the digital fields. In particular, big data in the financial industry has a large amount of data on hand and is growing rapidly. This will soon be an opportunity to increase my analysis capabilities and grow like Woori Bank by providing various analysis opportunities. One of the reasons for choosing Woori Bank is to deploy them as a digital group and then dispatch them to the business site. Most banks were dispatched to the business site immediately, and it seemed that they would be wondering what to do to maintain their analysis capabilities. However, Woori Bank will be able to prepare related capabilities in advance according to where they are deployed. After joining Woori Bank, I want to become an expert in developing a recommendation system or natural language processing. I want to develop a service that customers can immediately feel by developing a recommendation system for financial products. Or, I want to contribute to classifying users' transaction details or improving AI counseling services through natural language processing. Curiosity The 'digital DNA' I have is curiosity. Curiosity is the driving force behind finding an analysis problem. With this curiosity, I analyzed the data for the 2021 secondary school teacher general society appointment test. My friend thought about OOO as a support area for the appointment test. This is because the number of OOOs recruited is large, and I thought the cut line would be lowered. I wanted to check these expectations with data. A total of 8 regions were analyzed, and 6 years of data were used for each variable. There were not many variables, so a scatterplot was drawn to understand the relationship between each variable. When looking at the scatterplot, it was determined that there was a pattern between the number of applicants and cut lines by region, so we analyzed it by region. Of course, there was a limitation that there were not many samples by region, and not all regions were analyzed. However, it was a good experience to solve the problem of predicting test cut lines found out of curiosity through analysis. ""Capability to convert and solve data problems"" Even if you find an analysis problem with digital DNA called curiosity, it is meaningless if you do not have the ability to convert and solve data problems. In OO, we developed this capability by conducting an analysis project under the theme of proposing the location of additional rental stations for public bicycles. The key to the project was, 'How can we solve the proposed location of additional rental stations with data problems?' So what I came up with was to create a model that predicts the monthly capacity of a specific point based on the location of the facility and weather data. A total of 8 variables were selected as a forward selection method for linear regression analysis and a prediction model was created. The loan volume was predicted by applying this to the candidate group selected based on population density. In addition, we visualized the traffic marginalized areas by the number of additional bus operations and proposed six more rental stations at random. The roles I played in the above process were mainly data collection and pre-processing. In particular, I was proud to convert the location information of the facility into the number of existing near a specific point in the pre-processing. In addition, it was interesting to reduce the selected candidate group to K-means clustering for the efficiency of prediction. While working at our bank, I will find the analysis problem out of curiosity, which is my digital DNA. And I will contribute to solving the problem by converting it into a data problem. ""Improvement of withdrawal report service: classification of usage history"" I want to improve the deposit and withdrawal report service of Woori WON Banking. In the analysis of major expenditures, I would like to classify and provide more detailed information about customers' card payments. For example, how much food is spent per month, how much is spent on transportation, etc. are classified and provided. In particular, with the revitalization of the subscription economy these days, subscription services are consuming a considerable amount of money. Therefore, if you classify and present the amount you spend on subscription services, you will be able to effectively help manage customer assets in terms of consumption. To provide these services, you need data in which usage history is accurately classified. You will be able to use the One-Touch Notification app to obtain this training data. Instead of providing a simple memo function like now, it provides a function that allows users to label predetermined categories. And first of all, the One-Touch Notification app should provide a dashboard so that customers can actively classify usage details. If you continue this service until sufficient data is accumulated, you will be able to obtain high-quality training data. Finally, if you create a classification model with the acquired training data through natural language processing, you will be able to provide a customer's card payment usage history classification service."
"I applied to Shinsegae I&C because I can contribute to ITO and ITS business as a developer of MIS-based AI and SW solutions. Through this, I will be reborn as a leading IT service company and prime IT partner and value creator along with Shinsegae I&C. After understanding the ERP, CRM, and management strategies among the fundamental MISs of the target company, I have built up the capabilities to provide the optimal AI and SW solutions for scientific and intelligentization of customer business by applying the optimal SW architecture and technology. Regarding SW capabilities, based on LG CNS's field SW development processing model, we carried out the web and mobile SW app development team project and built up the capabilities applicable to field SW development. We performed the web full stack part by developing ""OOO"" and ""OOO"" web applications using Node JS, React JS, and DevOps in the OOO SW competition, and won the Excellence Award in the OOO SW competition. In addition, App Dev, IMGUR, and ""MusicMe"" Android mobile applications were developed using JAVA in OOOOOO-linked industry projects and software scholarships. Among them, OOO apps were selected as A grade among OOOOOO Capstone achievements. With regard to management domain and AI capabilities, AI research institute Securayer analyzed actual management big data of global companies such as Walmart and Amazon based on management domain knowledge and is preparing to present MFE and AutoML implementation papers to KCI Society through Meta feature extraction technology research research research for AutoML. Through this, we will implement IT platform and SW solution based on AutoML optimized for customer management big data. What I want to do in the supported SW development group is to provide optimal business SW solution by identifying the deep business needs and MIS core of various customers. This is because the job needs to manage the customer's business big data with ERP and develop applications such as CRM using it and SSG PAY that reflect actual marketing strategies. In this regard, I have experience in differentiated projects such as deriving requirement definitions, data modeling, and design patterns suitable for the consumer's business needs and developing SW apps accordingly. At the OOO SW contest, I produced the first educational support web app that complements the limitations of the official educational platforms 'e-learning center' and 'clasting', which are in the era of non-contact, through a survey of elementary school teachers and received the Excellence Award. The school's Capstone project is developing a web app to meet the growing pet demand due to the non-face-to-face and national economic crisis with a free pet consignment service. The OOO industry project is working on a team project to develop a mobile app that utilizes consumer public data to provide the optimal route for shopping at the lowest cost in the shortest time. As a software scholarship student, I completed a six-month exchange student course at OOO OOO. More than 20 team projects with foreigners by applying the latest technology in various SW fields. The APP_DEV project developed the mobile version app of IMGUR, an image sharing site, as JAVA, and carried out the DevOps project using Docker and Kubernetes. As a Capstone project, we developed a Java-based MUSICME mobile application. We were in charge of Arduino coding, UI development, and heart rate analysis algorithm development for the function of identifying users' mental conditions according to their heart rate and providing appropriate music accordingly. We will continue our innovative digital franchise after joining the company through our experience in completing more than 30 domestic and international projects, as well as SW and teamwork capabilities. In the summer of my fourth year, AI research institutes challenged me for an AI engineering internship. Of the seven laggle compositions, three were assigned within 40%, and four were assigned the prediction accuracy calculation within 100%, but we voluntarily challenged the goal of calculating the prediction accuracy within 40% of all seven. We set a goal to derive solutions focusing on complexes that derive solutions by analyzing the DB of global companies by utilizing the management major domain. At first, I thought that the possibility of achieving the goal was close to zero because I had the most insufficient data analysis experience and AI capabilities among interns. In fact, I was frustrated in the beginning because I didn't know how to use basic open sources such as PANADAS and Sikhitron. So to achieve the final goal, we classified the difficulty of the competition from 1 to 7 and selected seven competitions including one each for all difficulties, and established a strategy to achieve systematic competency growth and final goal through step-by-step overachievement. As a result of persistent competence, I achieved the best performance among interns beyond the final goal and received incentives and full-time offers. In addition, by challenging the study of meta feature extraction, we conducted an in-depth analysis of more than 15 English papers on MFE and AutoML, as well as the process of using existing MFE such as OpenML, Google Cloud AutoML, Sikhitron's AutoML library, and Feature selection algorithm recommendation paper. In the future, we plan to implement our own AutoML library based on MFE and OpenML and present academic conferences such as KCI. Based on this, even after joining Shinsegae I&C, we will challenge and challenge new technologies and learning, build necessary capabilities, and eventually overcome them. In addition, we will improve S Mind's AI customer analysis and ML process based on AutoML implementation capabilities, and build an optimal IT system and platform using customer big data analysis."
"1) This is a problem that I experienced when I developed the backend with Node JS and the front end with React JS in the process of developing the Web full stack in the BE SW contest. I planned the first educational support web application called ""OOO"" through the survey of elementary school education platforms and tools called ""eLearning Center"" and ""Clasting"" through the survey of elementary school teachers in the era of non-contact, and was originally in charge of backend development. It was equipped with an express server using Node JS, and managed members by connecting DB using NoSQL MongoDB. Then, the router for each function was set up using middleware on the express server, and the session was created and made available only when the user logged in. When user data was added to the mongodb by adding members, the password was encrypted and saved using the virtual function. Since then, the entire code has been subdivided into functional modules such as setting, database, route, etc. for ease of operation and management, and the OAUTH method of passport has been used to enable user authentication at log-in, including the FACEBOOK login function. Currently, we are developing real-time group chat room functions using socket.io technology. However, the problem occurred when we temporarily configured and tested the front end using the view engine and the seminal UI and connected the front end part of the team member developed with React to the back end code. I had to complete the front end source code that only the web design was completed and the function to transmit data to the back end using the post was not equipped. So I was able to learn about React JS through YouTube lectures that implement apps using Node JS and React JS. However, React JS is a technology that requires a lot of time to learn due to high learning curves, so it is currently difficult to understand the React JS source code of the team member and put in the necessary parts. I am currently trying to complete it into a complete application. Meanwhile, I was dispatched to OOO, the forerunner of OOO, in France, as a scholar to OOO, where I worked on DevOps projects using Docker, Ansible, and Kubernetes for eight weeks and implemented three web applications. I read official documents in English and learned about the concept, function, and implementation of DevOps. I put front-end source codes written in Python and Node JS, data transfer and storage capabilities using Redis and PostgreSQL, and back-end source codes written in Java in each cluster of digital ocean and then tried to learn how to schedule deployments through trafik and cadvisor. And I learned through trial and error how to create yaml files for each role. Eventually, the team succeeded in building and automatic deployment, implementing a voting service web application. And this became an important step in becoming a full-stack engineer through our teamwork and better utilization of DevOps. In addition, we studied meta feature extraction and AutoML, which lack the number of existing research papers because it is a new AI technology in the security layer, and analyzed more than 15 English papers in depth. As a result, we have built up our own AutoML implementation capabilities and will write a paper. We found that meta feature is defined as the characteristics measurements of dataet and is extracted from dataet for the purpose of measuring similarity between dataets. After that, we deeply analyzed the process of existing MFE application methods such as OpenML, Cykitron's AutoML library, and Feature selection algorithm recommendation paper. As a result, using the repository that stores existing databases such as OpenML and solutions for them, Cykitron's AutoML conducted meta-learning on the input dataset, extracted the learning algorithms and parameters used in the most similar dataset group, preprocessed and classified learning, Bayesian optimization, and optimized them with ensemble techniques to derive the optimal AI solution for the input dataset, and FS Algorithm concluded that it recommends the optimal FS model using meta learning. 2) I have experience leading the Capstone Project for 6 months at Android OOO OOO. Based on my initial business plan of identifying users' mental conditions based on heart rate and providing appropriate music accordingly, I gradually embodied the functions and design of the app with my team members. In addition, the team shared the vision that this would reduce users' daily stress and faithfully performed each other's parts for 6 months. I was in charge of Arduino coding, UI development, heart rate analysis algorithm search and development. We developed a basic UI and coded it with JAVA to enable movement between UIs by clicking buttons. And by coding Arduino, hardware and mobile were connected to Bluetooth, and the user's heart rate data was read with a sensor and visualized as a graph. However, the problem was that we could not implement an algorithm to estimate the user's psychological state by analyzing the data received from the sensor. This is because there was no research paper that clearly distinguished the section of the heart rate and distinguished the appropriate human psychology.Therefore, instead of calculating and analyzing the read heart rate data to determine the user's mental state, it was replaced with a function that visualizes it in a graph and shows it. On the other hand, since the psychological state cannot be grasped, the music recommendation function has been replaced so that the user's spotify account and app can be connected to use the spotify's own recommendation function. Overcoming the limitations of the absence of research papers, I completed an initial application called OOOO and was selected as an A-grade project by OOOO in recognition of the novelty of ideas and sincere process performance. I will become an AI backend expert who sympathizes with consumers and develop Naver's search engine and recommendation algorithms to best meet the needs of consumers. Currently, Naver's search and recommendation technology, in combination with AI technology, is focusing on improving keyword exposure, advertisement exposure, product exposure, image search, and translation services that have learned user search patterns. Through image search advancement, keyword challenge, influencer search, Q-brain technology to identify search intentions and provide customized search results, automatically recommend content in the field of interest without users having to search through AiRS technology, and through AiTEMS, technology that finds and recommends products that customers want to find and buy from vast product contents are being developed within Naver. In addition, I will improve the scope of search targets to a search engine that widely recommends not only domestic but also overseas English websites when searching for technical or English content. We will expand our pipeline with users to secure DBs for various search terms, and develop optimal recommender systems by using consumer psychology and marketing insights in business administration domain knowledge, thereby implementing a search algorithm that optimally meets the needs of consumers. Through this, I will become a managing developer that enables Naver to gain a competitive advantage in the competition between Baidu of China, currently the biggest competitor of global IT company Naver, and Google of the U.S. I completed a six-month exchange student course at OOO OOO. Based on a project-oriented curriculum, rather than a theory-oriented one in the computer engineering department of Korea, I had to self-directed learning of the latest SW practical skills in various fields such as security, network communication, games, web apps, mobile apps, and practical math algorithm development to complete more than 20 projects. I had to complete individual or team projects within a limited period of two to three weeks, and due to the difficulty of the curriculum, I often worked on two to three different projects at once. Working on projects for more than 50 hours a week, I felt a lot of pressure and limitations of physical strength every day. However, I was deeply immersed in this process, fascinated by the sense of achievement in learning new technologies and completing them with my colleagues. As a result of intensely carrying out projects in this learning environment and repeating self-reflection at the end of each project, I was trained to develop problem-solving skills, achieve the best practical results in a limited time, and acquire new skills in a short time. Eventually, I was able to complete all major projects with my colleagues at Epitech Paris, and as a developer, I was able to grow significantly in both teamwork and development capabilities."
"The motivation I applied to Woori Bank is that there are many things I can do related to the operation of the network infrastructure that I have studied and researched with interest, and I felt that I would be able to grow a lot. Woori Bank will have a very large network infrastructure in operation, and I think that the importance of stable operation of network infrastructure is more emphasized than any other company due to the nature of the company as a bank. I want to contribute to the stable operation of large network infrastructure that is practically commercialized beyond the laboratory, which is an academic environment. I am researching/developing the flow security control of the cloud cluster using eBPF/XDP to support the job that provides stable service for the network. The development is largely divided into: 1. Monitoring packets with eBPF in the kernel of the virtualized physical machine that makes up the cluster (including packets from the virtual machine) 2. Collecting the corresponding data and making the database of the entities responsible for security (I target DDoS) 4. Research/development of hardware-accelerated XDP-based firewall control system for blocking the corresponding malicious flow was actually done at the edge cloud cluster response testbed K-ONE playground, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology site, and achieved the results of the domestic/international society intervention (the best thesis award of the international society) and external presentation with the domestic/international journal submission (SCI). I was the leader of the demonstration team in the lab. The team members I worked with had different development tasks. Because of this, there were debates while working with each other, and it was difficult to resolve them and have everyone as a team. However, not only did we overcome these as a conversation and complete the demonstration, but we have also maintained a good relationship since then. The idea of the demo in our lab was to send the video from the IoT device to the edge cluster using SDN, and then to AI process the video from the edge cluster and send the result back to the display server. As many people were developing a demo, there were many minor issues, such as misalignment of each other's development directions and rebooting the physical machines that we were working on in collaboration. And the team members were also able to feel each other's emotions burn up and the relationship deteriorated when this happened. So I invited them all to have dinner together and sat down at a table and told them that if they collaborate, of course, they would complain. And I also stressed that since we are all students, anyone can make mistakes, and the next person who makes them may be themselves. And we agreed that if we make a little concession and understand each other, better results will come out. And we started to understand each other more. And that's how we started to understand each other more."
"""OOO - Analyzing Digital Signage Vulnerabilities and Presenting Security Guidelines"" I analyzed the vulnerabilities of digital signage called digital electronic signage in the second phase of OOO's operation from September to December 2019 at OOO, Korea, and I participated in the competition called 'Fiddler, Emulator, Wireshark, FTK manager, uart, and logical analogizer to analyze four platforms, model the threat of STRIDE, and write a paper. I was awarded the Excellence Award by the Korea OOO Association and received the Excellence Award at the Korea OOO Association for writing a paper on the vulnerabilities of the Digital Signage Management Solution and the security threat scenario using IR Relay. In addition, I have experience in reporting vulnerabilities by analyzing products of large domestic companies and receiving letters of appreciation. ""Find OOO Security Frailures Competition hosted by OOO"" I participated in the 'Find OOO Security Frailures' competition, which was held from November 30 to December 1, 2019. The competition was a competition to find vulnerabilities on OOO's homepage and rank them by scoring them based on what was reported. We hacked the web through proxy and JavaScript bypass, and as a result, we won the top prize. I have experience in having concept meetings and making plans every month to improve the quality of the articles of the ""AhnLab University Student Reporters"". It was my first time writing an article, and a lot of preparation was required to increase my professionalism. It may be convenient to write an article in a random way before a concept meeting and planning, but it did not guarantee the quality of the article. In this regard, we wrote about 10 articles by providing feedback and enhancing our expertise through dialogue. ""On-the-job training at the OOO OOO OOO Support Center"" I worked as a field trainee at the OOO OOO OOO Support Center for one month in January 2017, and have experience in writing a summary report on information protection measures for small and medium-sized enterprises (product, service status survey (at home and abroad), Japanese SMEs' information protection measures (at home and abroad), document file and contents summary analysis of the web vulnerability analysis result of small and medium-sized enterprises in OO area in 2016, and practice in writing an information protection education operation plan for employees of SMEs and college students in OO area (curriculum, personnel, period, public relations methods, etc.). In order to complete the assignment in a short period of time, I went to work 30 minutes earlier than others, made search and research a part of my daily life, and wrote it based on writing documents. ""Information Protection Club in my school"" From March 2013 to July 2014, I worked as an information protection club on campus. While working as a club, I have experienced reversing, algorithms, war game solving studies and seminars, and PC management program production projects. ""The bank that develops because of me"" I am an IT student. However, while seriously considering my senior year in high school, I learned about information protection, went to a related department, received several academic scholarships, and worked in the military after receiving several positions in the information protection class. During my military life, I felt the importance of time, and I felt regret that I had quit in the middle. However, up to this point, my weakness was that I lacked perseverance compared to the passion I wanted to do. When I joined the military, I met good executives and learned how not to give up on anything. As a result, I was able to win first place for the first time since the establishment of the unit in the squad leader education team that only the aces of each unit came to. Before I went to the military, I always studied various fields only through outward licking education, but after discharge, I think I should do it step by step properly, so I am continuing to challenge myself with persistence. I had the thought of living abroad at least once, and after discharge, I saved money and went to a working holiday. In addition, I started jiu-jitsu that I wanted to do but couldn't start because I was afraid, and I went to a municipal competition and won a silver medal. In addition, I also did my best in my major by working on projects like OOO and OOO, and made good results. When these experiences come together, I think that I can work with persistence every three days, always remind myself of my goals, overcome my shortcomings, and strive with passion to become a member of IBK Industrial Bank, I want to learn work step by step with the attitude of a passionate new employee, approaching first, and becoming a junior who is recognized by the customer, colleagues next to me, and seniors. ""Standards of failure, behavior."" I don't think I act on the standard of failure. There was a cause for me to live and work the way I do now. A friend asked me at a bar with a friend. ""Why do you live?"" The words that I always felt were playful came across as serious and heavy. When I tried to answer them, I couldn't think of an answer. In fact, it was right that I had never thought about it. I definitely thought I needed a reason to live, but I became lethargic about me living without a reason. Since then, I have been doing my best in everything so that I don't regret it when I have a reason to live. My major was good and my school life was not bad, but I had a short break to find the reason, and I wanted to take a leave of absence from school, but I started playing jiu-jitsu, which I couldn't try because I was afraid of it, and I was able to participate in a competition and even finish second place. Also, I went on a working holiday in Canada to achieve my bucket list of wanting to live abroad. My life in another country where I couldn't communicate was lonely and difficult. I thought it was an experience problem due to my lack of English, so I changed my phone and laptop settings to English and made a lot of efforts to become familiar with it. However, the feelings of loneliness and fear did not disappear even as my English increased. Come to think of it, it was a matter of confidence, and I did a lot of actions that approached me first. I was able to build intimacy by going out to play with colleagues I worked with during the day-off and playing games with friends I met at Jiu-Jitsu. Even if they lack English, if they can communicate to some extent, their English skills, which they lack compared to their native friends, became an attractive point for them.Even if I got the grammar wrong, I was able to improve my English by laughing, teasing, and teaching the correct sentence. Later, even though English was not my first language, I was told that you were really good, and I was able to improve my ability to guide my friends who came from Korea during the trip to the U.S. Now that I think about it, I think that the first six months in Canada were a failure of myself not to act with confidence. I felt regret that I could have lived a better life in another country and left more good memories. Since then, I have a attitude of acting confidently. ""A bank that helps customers achieve their dreams."" I have never found a reason to live a life that was a question of my friend. As I know that dreams themselves are valuable, I wanted to protect the dreams of customers who trust and use them to achieve them. I think IBK is a bank that makes customers' present and future dreams come true. If I join the company under the slogan of ""IBK"" that fosters hope, I will contribute to safe infrastructure operation and service construction with various experiences I have accumulated, and I really want to help customers keep their dreams and realize them. I have a variety of job competencies required to keep my customers' dreams alive. I had to learn various languages such as C.C ++, Python, and assembly language because I needed to study inside and analyze the vulnerable source code based on white boxes. As a result, I was able to achieve good grades in a number of programming subjects, and in the case of security, it was very helpful to know how to attack it to secure it. I was able to learn more about the technical aspects by joining the security club on campus, conducting club studies, and presenting seminars. As a member of the corporate college student journalist group, I was able to learn a lot about what was going on in the information security field since I was in the lower grade. In the case of the military, I was assigned to the information protection soldier in my own university and operated equipment such as NAC, UTM, and vaccine server to manage nodes and PCs under the military. After that, while working on an IT project, I was able to analyze the weaknesses of IoT equipment and digital signage that use Bluetooth with an incumbent mentor. In the case of the project, I was able to receive bugbounties and letters of appreciation in recognition of the project's achievements. In addition, by writing a paper on how to trigger related vulnerabilities, I received the Outstanding Papers Award at the OOOOOO Association Winter Conference and the Outstanding Papers Award for undergraduate students at the OOOOOO Association. In addition, I won the grand prize at the 'Find OOO Security loopholes' competition hosted by OOOOOO. I applied to the Industrial Bank of Korea because I believe that I can find the reason for living my life if I use these capabilities to operate safe services and help achieve my dreams of becoming a diverse person. ""A little help was a big help."" I went to a working holiday, but there were good things and bad things. I thought that I would like to share what I felt in my life and to have a better life so that the prospective working holidays would not make the same mistakes as me. While wondering if there was a good way to do it, I learned about external activities conducted by OOOOO and was selected as an overseas correspondent so that I could share local news such as events and visits to local restaurants through the Internet. Also, after visiting the working holiday, I was selected as an OOO by OOO and was able to hold a briefing session and give counseling to prospective working holiday participants. After some time, I received a thank-you message from the people who received counseling that it was a successful working holiday, and I learned that my small help can be of great help to someone. I was also selected as a buddy assistant who can help international students on campus, and I tried to help my Ukrainian friend in living abroad. I thought that I was my family and acted with a little knowledge that I had gained through my experience in living abroad and that if I were in that situation. In recognition of these small efforts, I was able to receive an award from Minister OOO. As such, I want to be a part of the role of the community to develop together by receiving the part that I can help and receive help."
"""Next generation security leader who strives steadily"" Information security that I studied is also called the flower of IT because you need to know all areas of IT in general to secure security. So I always had to find out a lot to take a step ahead. When a smartphone came out, I studied application security, and when the Internet of Things came out, I always wondered and studied what was different about it. As I needed to analyze the vulnerable source code, I needed to learn various languages, and I needed to know how to attack to secure it, so I created a virtual environment and practiced attack. In addition, I was able to learn the basics of information security from seniors by joining an information protection club, and as a university student journalist, I was able to learn a lot about what was going on in the information security field. In the case of the military, I was assigned an information protection soldier in my own university and managed nodes under the supervision by operating equipment such as NAC, UTM, and vaccine servers. In the case of the project, I was able to analyze the vulnerability of digital signage called digital electronic display boards in BoB activities, and in Han-eum, I was able to do a wireless security project. These experiences helped me to improve the security of the Korea Environment Corporation. ""The company that develops because of me"" I am a student who is very interested in information protection. When I was in high school, I only liked computer games and was not interested in information protection. However, while I was seriously considering my senior year in high school, I learned about information protection, went to a university department, received several academic scholarships, and worked in the military as an information security guard. However, up to this point, my weakness was that I lacked perseverance compared to the passion I wanted to do. However, I came to learn persistence by meeting good executives in the military. As a result, I was able to win first place for the first time since the establishment of the unit at the squad leader's training center on Onda. Before I left the military, I had always studied various fields only through superficial education, but after I was discharged from the military, I thought I should do it one by one step at a time, so I am continuing to challenge myself with persistence. When I overcome these shortcomings and became a member of the Korea Environment Corporation with passion, which is my strength, I want to become a junior who is recognized by seniors by learning work step by step from the attitude of new employees. ""Perfect teamwork, perfect achievement."" Last year, I was selected for the next generation security leader training program run by the OOO Research Institute and the second course was to form a team under the theme of ""Digital Signage Vulnerability Analysis and Countermeasures."" All the team members worked hard on the project in their respective fields, and I wrote the thesis data on the results of the web/hardware vulnerability analysis on digital signage. Finally, a large Korean manufacturing company won the Best Paper Award for Compensation for Bug Bounty for Vulnerability Analysis, the Korea OOO Association's Software Conference, the Excellence Award at the Korea OOO Science Association, and the Best Prize at the Korea OOO Corporation's Software Comprehensive Papers Competition. This resulted in the best-ever result in the eight-term curriculums for training next-generation security leaders. ""Strong when Together."" I believe that when we live in a community, we should make sure to have colleagues around us, rather than those who are empty without them. Everyone takes for granted that they always have colleagues next to them. Some colleagues' work seems to be more relaxed than me. However, if you try to do that person's work instead of him or her, you will realize that it was more difficult than you thought to take a break. As the person in charge of anything is an expert, I think the value should be recognized and respected. As I was working on the project, each team member had a different progress schedule and method, so I had a hard time coordinating my disagreements about the project schedule. However, since we were a team, we conceded individual preferences, wrote WBS, divided the schedule into stages, and shared tasks. We also shared work status through collaborative tools. One team member specialized in analysis, so he often played a role in opening the door to the team members by analyzing binaries before finding vulnerabilities. The team member redistributed the rest of the work to other team members, and through this process, we were able to reach our purpose much faster. I think we were able to achieve results that we could not do alone because of the concessions from each other. ""Promotion of Local Relocation Due to the End of the Landfillment Period in the Seoul metropolitan area"" In line with the end of the landfill period and the promotion policy of local relocation of public enterprises, I understand that the government is promoting the relocation of the Korea Environment Corporation to the provinces. However, Incheon's regional characteristics are close to the Korea Environment Corporation's research characteristics and play a major role in measuring fine dust. For this reason, I think the symbolic meaning of the location of an environmental public enterprise in Incheon is also significant. Although the government's local relocation policy is promoted as the justification for the end of the landfill period in the Seoul metropolitan area, the Korea Environment Corporation emphasizes that there are many other tasks and believes that they should be excluded from the companies subject to local relocation. I believe that the government should also prioritize understanding what are the disadvantages in considering the environment, rather than the benefits of balanced regional development. ""Passion, the driving force of my dreams,"" I am a passionate person. When electronic devices broke down, I had a hobby of disassembling and fixing them myself. Of course, there were times when they didn't work out, and sometimes they hurt themselves, but when they were fixed, I felt good and was interested in solving the problem. During my military life, I was assigned to the information protection team and worked. By managing PCs and servers under the military army, I improved my understanding of security settings. Later, while working on an IT project, I was able to analyze security weaknesses and other security weaknesses with my current mentor. Many will use these experiences to contribute to the stable and continuous operation of the Korea Environment Corporation and the improvement of the security of the system.I have studied information protection for a long time, and I think I have the potential to develop further. I will develop and develop this potential with the seniors who are working."
"""Applicant with practical experience"" When I was a student, I worked at the OOO OOO OOO OOO Protection Support Center as an intern for industry-academia cooperation. The OOO Protection Support Center is in charge of planning, implementing, and supporting education for small and medium enterprises/college students who do not have easy access to information protection. While working as an intern, I was selected as the next generation security leader training program operated by the OOO Research Institute last year. Information protection services for small and medium-sized enterprises and businesses are available for analysis of web vulnerabilities in the OOO area. - Product and service status survey (Korea and overseas), information protection education operation plan for employees of small and medium-sized enterprises and college students in the OO area (curriculum, personnel, period, promotional methods, etc.), and by practicing preparing summary report on information protection measures of Japanese SMEs, I was able to familiarize myself with the current status of SMEs. I believe that the experience of security support for SMEs will help the society pursued by the Small and Medium Venture Business Corporation. ""Perfect teamwork, perfect achievement."" Last year, I was selected for the next generation security leader training program operated by the OOO Research Institute of Korea and as the second course, I formed a team under the theme of ""Digital Signage Vulnerability Analysis and Countermeasures."" All of the team members worked hard on the project in their respective fields, and I wrote a paper on the results of the web/hardware vulnerability analysis on digital signage. Finally, OOO Electronics won the Best Paper Award at the CISCW Conference held by the OO Association, the Excellence Award at the Software Conference of the OO Science Association, the Excellence Award at the Undergraduate Papers Competition held by the OO Association of Korea. We were able to win the Best Prize at the 'Find the OO Security loophole' contest held by the OO Safety Corporation. This was the best result in the eight-term curriculums for training the next generation of security leaders. ""Strong when we are together."" When we live together in a community, I think that we should make our colleagues around us, rather than empty people without them. Everyone takes it for granted that they always have colleagues next to them. Some colleagues' work seems to be more relaxed than I am. However, if you try to do that person's work in lieu of you, you will feel that it was more difficult to take a break. As the person in charge of anything is an expert, I think you should recognize and respect their value. As I was working on the project, each team member had a different schedule and method of progress, so I had a hard time coordinating my differences over the project schedule. There were pros and cons of the team members, and accordingly, there was a convenient way for each team member. However, as we were a team, we were able to actively cooperate by giving up individual preferences and giving priority to the words of the PM, who was well aware of the strengths and weaknesses of the team members. PM assigned tasks to what each team member could do well, and since the rest of the team members were also good at reverse engineering, there was a team member who was only good at reverse engineering. In the case of this friend, he was specialized in analysis, so he played a role in opening the door to other team members by analyzing binaries before finding vulnerabilities. Through this friend's analytical ability, we were able to reach the goal much faster. I think we were able to achieve results that we could not do on our own thanks to each other's concessions. As I studied information protection, ""passion, the driving force of dreams,"" I came to think it was difficult but fun. I was able to learn more about the technical aspects by joining a hacking/security club on campus, conducting club studies, and presenting seminars. The military also applied as a computer soldier and received an information security soldier and worked. By managing the PCs and servers under the Corps, I was able to learn more about the importance of information protection, and I prepared/audited various security audits to enhance my understanding of security settings. After that, while working on the IT project, I was able to analyze the weaknesses of IoT equipment and digital signage using Bluetooth with my mentor in the office. If there are many, many, and if there are few, I will use these experiences to contribute to the improvement of the security of the Small and Medium Venture Business Corporation. ""The next generation security leader who strives steadily"" I did a lot of activities related to my application job. In particular, I focused a lot on information security. Information security is also called the flower of IT because you need to know all areas of IT in general to be secure. So I always had to find out a lot to be one step ahead. When a smartphone comes out, I study about application security, and when the Internet of Things comes out, I always wondered and studied what is different about it. Since it was necessary to analyze the vulnerable source code, I needed to learn various languages, and I needed to know how to attack to secure it, so I created a virtual environment and practiced attack. In response, I tried to increase my expertise by setting up the security settings again and retrying the attack, such as how is it secured or whether there is no other way around. In addition, I was able to learn the basics of information security from seniors by joining an information protection club, and became a college student journalist, so I was able to learn a lot about what was going on in the information security field from the lower grade. And in the case of the military, I was assigned an information protection soldier in my own university and operated equipment such as NAC, UTM, and vaccine servers to manage nodes under the supervision. In the case of the project, I was able to analyze the vulnerability of digital signage called digital electronic boards in BoB activities, and in Han-eum, I was able to do a wireless security project."
"""Power Supply"" When I was a freshman in high school, I left my apartment for 12 years and moved to a new one. After moving in, a typhoon called Prapiroon hit Korea in August, and I experienced a power outage I had never experienced. When I woke up from my sleep and the house was in a mess, my mother and father turned on the flashlight on my cell phone and informed me that a power outage occurred. At this time, our entire apartment suffered a power outage for about an hour. During the blackout, we didn't have access to air conditioners, refrigerators, and even bathroom lights. The experience that electricity, which we always took for granted, disappeared instantly like this to understand the importance of stable power supply. Based on what I learned in programming class, I became interested in the fields of communication and development by realizing socket communication with thermal imaging cameras. Since then, I have experienced things like building web servers in projects. In addition, at the 6th Korea SW Convergence Hackathon, one of the intelligent transportation system services, we tried to develop a small model and management website in a short time of 42.195 hours by thinking of a variable lane that changes according to traffic volume, and I was in charge of developing an API server between the hardware and the website in this project. We built a server that receives traffic volume from hardware and informs the calculated variable lane through the website. Working for KEPCO, I would like to try to reduce the power failure time by closing the fault section and transmitting power through the bypass distribution line even if a power failure occurs through stable maintenance of the distribution intelligence communication network (DAS). In addition, I want to contribute to the improvement of the stability of the operation of large-scale AMI communication network by making efforts to advance the intelligent remote meter reading system (AMI). I want to contribute to the construction of servers for two-way information service of smart grids. I think one of the important concepts of smart grid business is the exchange of power usage information between electricity providers and electricity users. Also, a small concept server will be needed in order for individual power facilities to be connected to each other and exchange information. During the in-school software development competition held while in high school, my team computerized functions such as inquiring about penalty points, applying for songs, renting laptops, and managing access, shared information on the web and apps, and built a central server for hardware control and consistent processing to implement a real-time web page. While building a server that has to support various platforms such as web pages, hardware, and apps, I received the Excellence Award by setting consistent communication rules and implementing them so that I can easily access the central server and take information from various platforms. In the case of the dormitory laptop rental system, which was implemented by the change of the dormitory laptop rental method, I have experience in building a server where the application page is opened at a certain time and many requests are generated in a short time. At first, there was a problem of slowing down the processing of the server when many requests occurred, but I reduced the load on the server by changing the method of the server to distribute and process the user's requests across various processes. Through the above experience, I want to document and process the information produced by various power facilities and ensure that the server does not stop even if a large amount of data occurs. In addition, I would like to contribute to the creation of a consumer-oriented power market ecosystem through interactive information services between users and power management systems by allowing users of the smart meter to directly inquire information such as their real-time power usage through communication efficiency between the power management system and the data concentration device. At the end-of-year software development festival held on campus, our team tried to create a notification and communication website for students and teachers on campus. At first, during the development meeting, most of our team members were familiar with web development, so they tried to develop the website, and that's how they tried to develop it. Then, one of the team members underestimated his ability and refused to participate, saying there was nothing they could do. At first, I just thought that it was because they didn't want to do it. I think there can always be friction or conflict in human relationships. So, I decided to ask the team member if he wanted to develop something other than what he could do and the direction of the project he was working on, and listen to him. When I talked with the team member, I learned that he wanted to develop an app that he was more interested in. At first, I thought I simply didn't want to do it, but I came to reflect on myself for judging without even talking. After hearing that, I talked with all the team members and changed the direction of development by dividing the web service that was originally intended to be developed into a website using an API server and an Android application. All of the team members participated by changing the direction of development by communicating separately, and I played roles such as API server and development schedule management. It was a development festival that I did not learn much, and there were many difficulties in developing it by proceeding it at a time when I did not learn much, but still, a visible product came out, and the festival successfully displayed and presented. ""Development of an after-school course registration website"" The existing after-school class registration website was used by the school using a solution from an external company, paying a monthly fee. While using the site, I thought of additional functions such as the inconvenience of applying for after-school classes and the password that is initialized every time, so I told the teacher in charge that I wanted to develop an after-school website as a project so that students could use it at school. The teacher in charge had high expectations that if the students developed it, the cost of the monthly solution used by the school could be used to improve the quality of after-school classes. The project was carried out by two front-end developers, two back-end developers, one design, and five people.The project was carried out in the order of function design, design and development schedule establishment, front-end development, back-end development, pre-deployment test, manual creation, and distribution. I was in charge of function design and back-end development, manual production, API document production, and I was able to create an efficient course registration website by continuously discussing with the front-end development team. The website supports functions such as after-school course registration, change, cancellation, announcement, satisfaction survey, demand survey, and teacher introduction. Unlike the websites of external companies, functions such as satisfaction survey, announcement, demand survey, and teacher introduction have been added. The project was successfully completed. As a result, the school reduced the cost of solutions, and students were able to conduct after-school classes and satisfaction surveys they wanted to listen to on one website. In addition, with the reduced solution cost, the budget for textbooks and snacks for after-school classes helped improve the quality of after-school classes."
"We have made the following efforts to equip KEPCO KDN with creativity, expertise, customer orientation, and reliability. ""We have changed the way we apply for after-school classes."" The website for applying for after-school classes, which was previously used on campus, was used by the school by paying a monthly fee using a solution from an external company. While using the site, I told the teacher in charge that I would like to develop the website as a project so that students can use it at school, considering additional functions such as the inconvenience of applying for after-school classes and the password that is initialized every time. The project was carried out in the order of function design, design and development schedule, front-end development, back-end development, pre-distribution test, manual production, and API documentation. I was in charge of function design and back-end development, manual production, and API documentation, and I was able to create an effective course registration website by continuously discussing with the front-end development team. ""We have developed a website that facilitates the life of dormitory students."" In my school, where I lived in dormitory, I had to take my laptop to the dormitory every day by filling out a laptop rental register located in a specific place for self-directed learning. We proceeded with a two-person project and established a PHP-based website for practical use. We have improved our IT system management capabilities by reflecting the user's requirements, checking for problems or errors that occur during actual use, and blocking access to the macro. In addition, we restricted the ports connected to the server to prevent leakage of laptop application information, ID, and personal information, and took measures to notify them by e-mail when requested or when illegal access was made, and stored information that did not need to be decrypted, such as user's password and laptop application information, by one-way encryption. KEPCO KDN is a company that provides services such as power system management by applying advanced ICT technology to all processes of the power system. In addition, we support stable advanced ICT technology to power customers and suppliers for stable and efficient power supply. Electric power supply is an essential element in the lives of the people, and KEPCO KDN is responsible for providing the supply and support of advanced ICT technology in this power supply. ""As a self-governing committee for dormitories, I developed, operated, and maintained websites related to dormitories."" Based on my experience in managing IT systems such as dormitory management websites and laptop rental websites, I can provide stable power ICT services through monitoring, continuous inspection, and maintenance of power ICT services such as transmission and substation automation systems and power system operation systems. ""I have experience in developing a central API server."" At the 6th Korea SW Convergence Hackathon, I carried out a project to create a variable lane model and program according to changes in traffic volume. I received traffic volume information from hardware, calculated a more efficient variable lane system through traffic volume calculation, and developed a central API server that provides current information and calculation information to the website. Based on the above experience, I believe that I can contribute to supplying and supporting advanced ICT technologies by carrying out website development and server development tasks such as developing a central system server of KEPCO KDN's transmission and substation automation system. ""Job Training for Building Practical Experience"" The experience of participating in competitions and projects on and off campus is also important, but I wanted to learn work in the actual field. As a result, I was dispatched to the job training of the industry on campus to assist in actual development work. I was in charge of analyzing the loan, investment consultation, and completion status through the company's SNS and implementing it so that it can be checked every certain time. To solve this task, I used a user behavior analysis tool called Amplitude. This information has been parsed into Python and implemented to periodically provide the information through AWS Lambda on the company's SNS consisting of Slack. Unlike what I learned at school and experienced during the project, I experienced a lot of additional functions when I used and used it in my actual company. In addition, it helped me understand how the company conducts and promotes work through periodic meetings, team members, and employee meetings while proceeding with this development. ""Development of a dormitory laptop rental site"" The number of students in the dormitory study room has been limited due to COVID-19. At this time, the dormitory self-governing committee decided to receive the use of the study room by the students on a first-come, first-served basis, and since it was difficult to conduct it offline, it was decided to develop a new dormitory laptop rental website. In a short period of five days, I was in charge of server construction and backend development. When it was first introduced, many users flocked to the same time, causing the system to slow down. So, even if we access at the same time, we have optimized the number of times we communicate with the database and client to ensure that the system does not slow down even if a large number of requests occur. There were no additional functions due to the lack of time to develop a single system in a short period of time, but we actually experienced requests from many users and how important it is to optimize the algorithms handled by the server. ""We solved the situation where response speed and security conflict in the local courier system."" We created a blockchain-based local courier service produced at the 5th OO OOO Competition in Korea. When a customer receives a package, the token owned by the customer is pre-verified to all users before passing it to the local courier, and the token is paid through the transaction after the verification. The system is very secure, but when the number of users increases during actual service, the response speed is very slow. The pre-transaction verification process has been changed.The ledger owned by the customer was compared with the ledger of the local courier, 10 inspectors were randomly extracted, and the central server was changed to supervise it. Due to the nature of the local courier service to be implemented, the central server was changed to verify this transaction because it is a blockchain system that requires the central server of the Post Office. At first, there was an opinion that it was against the blockchain system, but in the case of corporate blockchains, a central server exists and the central server only supervises the verification process itself, so it cannot affect inspectors and traders. I think the speed of response experienced by customers is very important. However, in order for the service to remain stable, security is important, so we prioritized security and tried to reduce response time. KEPCO KDN is a company that provides total services applied with advanced power ICT technology to companies such as KEPCO, and I think that cooperation with other companies and institutions will be frequent. Therefore, as an employee of a public institution pursuing the public interest, a sense of ethics will work more importantly. While working as the Dormitory Autonomy Committee, there was a request from ordinary students to disclose the contents of the Dormitory Steering Committee. Disclosure of information would result in additional review and work, but I wanted to receive better complaints. All the contents that can be disclosed to ordinary students should be disclosed through the minutes, and the contents of the meeting were proposed to the dormitory management committee to collect questions and complaints through the complaint window, and the contents of the meeting were disclosed from the next session. Since the disclosure, ordinary students have given ideas about the contents of the steering committee. When working through this, I felt that the interests of the whole group should be given priority over the interests of the individual. As a public institution that provides essential services to the lives of the people, I believe that all employees should work with the right ethical consciousness. Therefore, rather than pursuing individual interests, I think we should pursue a work method that pursues the public interest and the interests of the company."
"I have the advantage of having gained knowledge of programming languages while I was in high school. In the web programming class, I learned how to structure a basic web page, and in the programming class for the first time, I gained programming thinking and basic knowledge by learning the C language. The skills I have have built up my ability to write programs through several software projects in high school. In addition, after I became interested in web pages, I made a website for dormitory management during the software engineering class and provided real Internet services using a real MySQL database and a Linux server. In addition, when I was in the first year of high school, I learned the Java programming language to study object-oriented programming. In the 6th Korea SW Convergence Hackathon, my team developed a small model and a management website with the idea of a variable lane that changes according to traffic volume, an intelligent transportation system service using SW convergence technology, and succeeded in developing it in a short time of 42195 hours In my school, where I lived in dormitories, I had to take my laptop to a certain place every day to fill out a laptop rental register for self-directed learning. It was very uncomfortable for me that I had to fill out a laptop rental register every time I borrowed a laptop to take my laptop to the dormitories. So I suggested adding a feature that allows me to fill out the laptop rental register online when I set up a dormitory management website. So, students can access the dormitory management website with their laptops, log in to fill out the notebook rental register for the job, and provide a system that provides students with the convenience of students, the status of the dormitory laptop rental, and outputs visible in real time. The management of the dormitory board and the dormitory supervisor was also made simple. Some people think that the handwritten laptop rental that they take for granted has brought the convenience of both students and managers by allowing them to write the rental register using their laptops. In high school, while working on a team project, one of my team members underestimated his ability and did not try because he wanted to implement an app that provided a simple service that he originally proposed. However, other team members wanted to implement a web service by building an embedded system, so we decided to build an embedded system and a web service that many team members wanted. When his opinion was not reflected, he underestimated his ability and said he would not participate. So, my team member and I decided to provide additional app services, which is an area that the team member is good at, and we proposed to the team member again how to build a backend server by converting it from the original web service to a central API server, and successfully implemented and introduced all of the embedded system web apps. If we meet a team member with a similar tendency after joining the company, we will properly collect the opinions of the team member and do our best to prevent departure by making every effort to reflect the validity of the opinions and to some extent, not just the opinions of the majority. The Korea Financial Information Service operates and manages the digital budget accounting system, dBrain, and the national government subsidy integration platform, e-country help, and financial statistics. It is understood that the next-generation budget accounting system is being built. Once this next-generation budget accounting system is newly established, it will enable efficient financial management, detect duplicate projects, predict appropriate balances of state funds, and integrate and manage national financial information. It will contribute to the development of society as a whole to create social values by contributing to the development of society. Based on what we learned in high school microprocessor classes and programming classes, I think it can contribute to streamlining tasks that require a lot of traffic and multiple operations a day. I would like to design a normalized DB in the system and perform minimal operations, so that stable services can be provided despite many requests. The case in which I solved the problem by demonstrating my leadership was a school called Self-directed Career Experience Activities, in which about 68 students of the same grade went on a three-day trip for self-directed career experience activities. All students produced and submitted one plan per person, gathered these plans, selected a good plan, and led the students to make reservations, research, and recruit guidance teachers. I submitted a plan under the theme of Cultural Experience Activities and Career Experience Volunteering, and I was selected to go to Seoul with six friends including myself for self-directed career experience activities. Although it was difficult to do various documentation activities such as writing a spending resolution and processing receipts for the first time, I was selected as an excellent team leader after completing the self-directed career experience activities by carefully writing them and encouraging the team members. These activities gave team members an opportunity to learn how to achieve their team's goals by allowing them to communicate with each other by periodically sharing the progress and collecting opinions. Through this leadership, I think I can contribute to the team's performance by continuously communicating with the team members after joining the company so that the direction does not go wrong"
"I have the execution power to always challenge myself like Hyundai's GV80. Genesis started out as a sedan, succeeded in positioning itself in luxury, and achieved outstanding brand power. However, Hyundai Motor did not settle for success and launched its luxury SUV, bringing about another success with the title of 'the first domestic premium SUV.' I think the GV80's symbol of constant challenge looks like me. I studied programming, basic statistics, and machine learning while working at big data conferences for a year. I formed a team with the goal of gaining analysis experience and participated in six contests. I was able to prove my skills by winning three awards, but I was not complacent. Even after finishing the conference's activities, I learned deep learning techniques that were not in the curriculum, and tried to acquire collaboration skills by studying Git. I think this challenging execution power is an attitude required of workers in the fast-developing big data field. Hyundai Motor's global internship is also an extension of this challenge. I want to actively reflect on my analysis capabilities in my business through internships. I would like to access the high-quality customer data that Hyundai Motor has accumulated over a long period of time to discover unknown insights. The amount of variables will be significant because Hyundai Motor's customer data is collected from various channels such as sales sites, the web, and apps. I would like to apply various methodologies to find the criteria for customer segmentation by exploring all variables one by one. While studying data analysis, I was interested in customer data. I enjoyed the process of analyzing people's behavior in multiple dimensions and finding meaning. It was interesting that this intern analyzed customer data, derived results, and established strategies together through cooperation. We decided that the project could create synergy and promote personal growth. Considering the specificity and cooperation of the data, I think customer data affinity and communication skills are required. Through the competition, I received credit information and card consumption data by customer type from OOO, analyzed, and produced a dashboard. Based on the analysis results, I created a variable called customer type by using the variables of card consumption and loan type compared to income. Types such as 'blind eyes' and 'witted' were visualized as icons and placed in the center. I created a dashboard with a structure in which different analysis results are placed around it to explain the types. It was recognized for its user-friendliness in OOO and won third place. Understanding customer data learned a lesson that you also need to understand customers. I worked as an intern at OOO last year and developed communication skills. In the process of collecting the list of OO products sold on overseas websites, I tried to automate work by using R. The team had about 60 different websites, and it was difficult for them to come up with the code that fits the structure of each site alone. We needed a way to handle our work efficiently without burdening our team members. Accordingly, we provided the team members with data forms for crawling and a form that summarizes the characteristics of the website. Using the collected information, we were able to easily understand the structure of the website. We produced about 40 codes in two months while reproducing about two codes a day. The team members used them in turn and shortened the work time from 5 to 3 days. We realized that we could improve work efficiency through cooperation. I participated in the 6th OOOO Big Data Competition last year and proved my excellent problem-solving ability. Our team came up with a model that recommends products to non-member online customers for supervised learning for classification purposes. The problem was the performance of the model. Since the model was learned targeting 1,600 different kinds of products, the given variables were not enough to explain. I tried to use weather data additionally and processing existing variables, but they were not enough. In this situation, the variables I paid attention to were the traditional marketing factors, gender and age. It was found that the relative proportion of purchasing certain products differs according to gender and age, such as ""Men in their 20s are drinking beverages and women in their 40s are meat."" Although we judged that ratio was an important variable, there was a limitation that it could not be applied to non-members who did not leave personal information. At this time, we came up with a method of treating missing values with supervised learning models. We thought that we could identify the gender and age of non-member customers and use them as variables. Accordingly, we designed a dual structure algorithm that identifies non-members with a model learned from member data and recommends products by using it as a variable. The results were amazing. When tested assuming that some of the member data were non-members, the model that identifies gender and age showed 86% accuracy, and the product recommendation showed 50% accuracy. The importance of the two variables in the model also appears high, allowing us to verify the explanatory power of the dual structure. The availability of marketing elements and algorithm-based recommendation performance were emphasized during the final screening. In recognition of its creativity and excellence, it was praised for being the ""most unique among the participants"" and received the top prize. I was able to develop flexible thinking that solves problems by using existing methodologies creatively, not just as they are."
"""Steady Growth for Vision AI"" Vision AI is a promising field that can be applied not only to robots or autonomous driving but also to the game industry. In 2015, I became interested in Vision AI when I heard that AI exceeded the recognition rate of human vision with the advent of ResNet. I developed a game based on image recognition in the Capstone design project on campus and learned basic knowledge of computer vision. It was a game where the score obtained by driving the sign object recognized while controlling the RC car was evaluated. It was a good opportunity to think about how to optimize Vision AI by reflecting it in game elements. I went to a master's degree to study Vision AI in more depth. I mainly conducted industry-academia projects that researched computer vision algorithms such as detection and recognition for objects using deep learning. I wanted to develop myself constantly even during the period when I did not carry out industry-academia projects, and I told the professor about it, and he helped me with projects from outside companies and gave me the opportunity to experience practical affairs. For six months, I developed an OCR algorithm based on deep learning to be applied to embedded. Object Tracking and Object Recognition algorithms were implemented for image analysis required in a real-time environment. We experienced various issues such as the necessity of lightweight deep learning, data inflation, and anomaly detection, and we grew by solving problems that we could not learn only with research. We have developed our capabilities in computer vision and deep learning through various project experiences. Furthermore, I applied to NCsoft, which is leading the innovation of the entertainment business, in order to become the subject of game development applied with Vision AI technology in the future. Based on the VIsion AI research experience, it will help to quickly grasp and develop the development flow. In my fourth year of undergraduate school, ""Achievement of goals through constant improvement"", I was encouraged by my supervisor to link the capstone design project to the nation's largest ICT contest. About 430 teams participated and only 16 teams received main awards, so our team, which lacked project experience at the time, knew that it was difficult to win the award. However, we set a goal of challenging the award through constant efforts and started the project with the support of our supervisor. Before submitting to the contest, we first received an interim evaluation on campus. Contrary to expectations that I would receive good reviews, I was criticized by professors for failing to present clear results and being fed up with my ideas, and I was given the result that I was last in the department. It was difficult to think that the project I had been preparing had failed, but I didn't want to disappoint my supervisor. Once I experienced the last place, I felt that there was no reason to be afraid of failure anymore, and I decided to use this as an opportunity to blessing in disguise and start the project again. Fortunately, the team members were not frustrated with the failure, and with the determination to do their best, I focused on development by reducing sleep. We changed the direction of the project to elements that people would sympathize with and like more, and systematically planned the development process again. When more professional opinions were needed, I visited as many professors and company practitioners as possible, listened actively to their advice, and looked for improvements. As it said, ""Efforts do not betray,"" we won first place in the on-campus engineering competition, and in the ICT competition, we were ranked in the top 10 out of 430 teams and received the main award. Even if we experienced failure, we were able to achieve our goal thanks to consistently improving the project without giving up. It was the best experience to complete the project safely, giving the professor the joy of success. Vision AI is a technology that is still developing, so I think it is important to have an enterprising attitude to do anything for research and development. During my master's degree, I developed an enterprising spirit by working on a project related to deep learning vision called 'Research on Intelligent Automatic Programming Technology for Web Applications'. Since my affiliated lab is a new lab, I have been the head of the lab since the first semester of my master's degree, and I often coordinated my work on behalf of the advisor, who was away often due to busyness. It was unfamiliar because it was my first role, but I worked with an enterprising attitude thinking that I was entrusted by the professor, so I worked with it. I was in charge of implementing the overall back-end Vision AI algorithm, and I shared the roles of the front-end and deep learning data learning for the other motives. It was my first time encountering a project related to deep learning, but I faithfully performed my role, while sharing information that could be helpful for the work of other motives. At the end of the development, I was in charge of business trips for TTA certification and patent applications on behalf of my advisor. I was afraid because I was unfamiliar with both tasks, but I prepared the data by meticulously organizing the principles of the main algorithms and the experimental results with the responsibility of the program I made myself. I passionately pursued my work and safely completed TTA certification, and I also successfully registered a patent. While performing this task, I became accustomed to explaining the differentiation and excellence of certain principles in an easy-to-understand manner, and I wrote my research in a paper and won the top thesis award at an academic conference. I gained confidence that I could do anything if I took an enterprising attitude even if it was my first encounter. Even after joining the company, I will always be reborn as a researcher working on development with an enterprising spirit of challenge and passion for Vision AI."
"Last year, while working as an intern at OOOO, I immersed myself in crawling with the aim of automating my work. The main task was collecting the list of OO products sold on overseas websites. The team members felt tired from the simple repetition work of finding products one by one and writing them in Excel, and there was a setback in the task of collecting information from 50 websites a week. To improve the situation, I tried to automate my work using R, which I was studying personally. Even after work, I studied the code separately, collected product lists from the five websites and compared them with existing results. There was no significant error from the method of collecting by hand, so I reset the goal of expanding to other websites. However, it was difficult to apply the existing method of R to websites with complex structures, and I had difficulty in organizing many codes alone. While thinking about it, I asked my senior in the data analysis department for advice and was encouraged to use Python. Although I had a vague fear of learning a new language, I started studying with a sense of mission that I could improve the work efficiency of the team. Fortunately, I was able to easily learn Python because I had the basics of coding with R. With the ability to utilize Python, I was able to develop my ability to cope with various dynamic elements of the web. In addition, I provided the team members with data forms for crawling and forms that summarize the characteristics of the website. Using the information collected by the team members, I was able to easily grasp the structure of the rest of the website. I quickly reproduced about three codes a day. As a result, we produced about 40 codes in three months, and the team members used them one by one, reducing the time required to work from five to three days. I learned that small attempts can have a positive impact on the organization. Last year, I participated in the OOO Big Data Competition and proposed a unique structure of algorithms that used marketing elements. Our team came up with a model to recommend products to non-member online customers for supervised learning for classification purposes. The problem was the performance of the model. Since the model was learned with 1,600 different types of products as the target, the given variables were not enough to explain. I applied weather data and processed and used existing variables, but they were not enough. In this situation, the variables I paid attention to were the traditional marketing elements, gender, and age. It was found that the relative proportion of purchasing a specific product differs according to gender and age, such as ""drink for men in their 20s and meat for women in their 40s."" Although it was judged to be an important variable, it could not be applied to non-members who did not leave personal information. At this point, I came up with a method of treating missing values with a supervised learning model. I thought I could identify the gender and age of non-member customers and use them as variables. Accordingly, we designed a dual-structure algorithm that identifies non-members based on the model learned from the member data and recommends products by using it as a variable. The results were surprising. When tested assuming some of the member data as non-members, the model that identifies gender and age showed 86% accuracy, and the product recommendation 50% accuracy. The importance of the two variables in the model also appears high, so the explanatory power of the dual structure can be verified. The main screening emphasized the availability of marketing elements and algorithm-based recommendation performance. In recognition of its creativity and excellence, it was praised for being the ""most unique"" among the participants and received the top prize. It was realized that novelty comes from familiarity. Type: International Company: OOO Corporation Department: Content Planning Team Period: 2019.09-11 [Details] (within 10 paragraphs) OOO is a startup that operates a big data competition platform as a 'Korean Cagle'. I worked as an intern at OOO and was in charge of running the competition. Before the competition, I received data from the client, preprocessed it in a form suitable for machine learning, and briefly analyzed the data. After the competition was over, the winner's code was verified and analyzed. While working on the operation, I was able to experience raw data from various fields such as electricity usage, traffic volume, and satellite images. In addition, I was able to learn quality insights while analyzing the winner's code. Type: Contest: Organizing/Hosting: OOO Financial Style Visualization Contest: OOO/OOO Period: 2019.07 - 08 Result: Third Place [Details] (within 10 paragraphs) I was in charge of creating a dashboard for credit inquiry service using the tableau. I thought about what kind of content I needed from my users and created a variable called customer type based on my income and credit score. Types such as 'blind eyes' and 'witted' were visualized with icons and placed in the center. A dashboard was created with a structure where different analysis results were placed around it to explain the types. As a result, KCB won third place in recognition of its user-friendliness. It was a special experience to understand the situation of platform users instead of codes and familiar analysts. Type: Club Club: OOO (OOO) Period: 2019.01 - 2020.03 [Details] (within 10 paragraphs) I learned machine learning techniques using R and Python at the big data conference. While studying theory and code at the same time, I studied what packages to use in each language to apply the techniques. To verify the learning results, I teamed up with members of the conference to participate in a contest and achieve results. Even after finishing the year-long session, we proceeded with a stock price prediction project, and continued to study deep learning based on TensorFlow, and did not let go of the keyboard. While struggling with debugging in the flood of various codes, I was able to have a strong mind that did not fear the codes I met for the first time. Type: Competition: KBO OPS Performance Modeling/Visualization Competition Host/supervision: OOO Period: 2019.03 - 07 Result: 5th Place [Details] (within 10 paragraphs) As the team leader, I combined the analysis code performed by the team member into a single report and interpreted the final result. The key was to reduce the number of baseball players' performance variables and apply clustering techniques. I thought I fully understood it at the planning stage, but there were difficulties in interpreting and merging the code.I was able to understand the context step by step by step by looking at the code line by line with each team member and asking questions, and through such efforts, I was able to derive a meaningful interpretation of 'the growth type of others'. It was an experience to learn the importance of communication in the project. Type: Competition: OOOO Academy Competition: Organized/organized: OOOO Date: 2019.08 Result: None [Details] (within 10 paragraphs) The challenge was to predict demand for the cafeteria using OOO's own data analysis platform. I was in charge of creating a random forest model using the analysis platform. I was able to find some inconveniences while using the platform myself. It was an opportunity to think about the factors that the platform should have, taking into account the limitations of model types, complex non-preprocessing APIs, and uniform debugging. Although it was not a successful competition, it was an experience to test the beta version and understand the platform that the company would use."
"I heard that there will be a thesis competition held at the OOO conference, ""The Best Prize I Ever Did."" Therefore, I submitted a thesis to find out what I could do within that field. When I first decided to write a thesis, I aimed for the top prize. However, since most of the participants were graduate students in the master's and doctoral programs, I thought that my chances of winning the thesis might be slim. However, I believed that if I tried harder than them and went in a good direction on a topic during the given time, I would achieve my goal. I had to complete a thesis in less than two months, so I had difficulty managing my time. In particular, it took more time than planned to acquire relevant knowledge by setting the theme of ""OOOOOOOO technology."" I felt very nervous about not falling behind my competitors. However, I thought that I could overcome it only by trying harder than I lacked. I read as many papers as possible from famous overseas journals, and I completed them by modifying the code day and night, regardless of weekends. After all these efforts, I was able to submit my thesis in a timely manner, and I was highly appreciated for incorporating the latest technologies into my thesis, so I won the Best Papers Prize. ""Early adopter seeking efficiency"" I was in charge of collecting Internet comments while working as an intern at OOO company. Many interns copied and pasted their writings over and over again. However, I thought this process was inefficient and wanted to implement an efficient system through programming. When I reported to the team leader that I would study about the related technology, he received a good idea. However, since I had to finish the work within the period, if I could not secure the technology within the promised period, I decided to use the existing method. If I failed, it could be a waste of time, but I thought that there would be no progress without challenges, so I boldly executed it. That's how I learned about web crawling. It was a technology that fetched texts and pictures that existed on the web, and through the latest package called N2H4, I was able to implement it in R, a programming language. Through this, I was able to finish the work quickly, and I made a program file so that other interns could easily use it. I don't think that investing a lot of time will unconditionally pay off. I think it will be better to understand how to work efficiently within a given time and use new technologies if there are any. I will not be a person who recklessly goes to work and spends time, but a C&C person of SK Corporation who thinks for better results and knows how to incorporate new things."
"""Face Recognition Cosmetics Trial MakeApp"" When I was in fourth grade, I had the experience of creating the MakeApp application while taking the Software Engineering class. As a team project, I learned the software engineering process that I learned in class and applied the process directly to the project. ""MakeApp"" produced by the project is an application that provides Face Recognition Cosmetics Trial service. It is a basic camera application that directly trial cosmetics on the face through face recognition and connects websites for purchasing. There are two reasons why this project was interesting. First, I realized that software engineering documentation work was very important. To plan and implement software, it goes through the processes of User Requirements, Design, Testing, and Maintenance. Software engineering such as ""Design"" gave a different feeling from the project that I planned in my head and proceeded with coding right away. I was able to do more systematic and fast distributed work by dividing the implementation by requirements with my team members. In the implementation stage, I took charge of three requirements including 'View Cosmetics Information to Buy', which crawls the REST API over the network and implemented them. The most impressive experience was in the testing stage. For me, it was the first testing I experienced after programming. When testing was conducted based on requirements, I realized how important the software structure I had set in advance was. In reality, there was no big problem, but I set the testing scope in advance so I could see in detail which part I needed to check. I had previously worked on an engineering documentation project in the subject of 'Domain Analysis and SW Design', but I remember that it was difficult due to many trials and errors. However, in this project, it was my second engineering work, so I felt more comfortable and familiar. Second, it was my first English class and I worked with foreign friends, so it was a very memorable project. During the project, we communicated for about four months thinking that both our foreign and Korean friends made the same software. I was impressed by the leadership of my foreign friend, the leader, and it was an experience that I first felt that programming languages are a common language in the world. ""Dream of becoming a Software Engineer"" I tried to acquire the software engineering skills by taking SW-related courses step by step. In the 1st and 2nd grades, I gained basic programming knowledge and skills starting with C language. I got good grades in the basic programming course, so I started to dream of becoming a software engineer. And in the 2nd grade, I developed basic computer knowledge and programming skills by taking tasks such as MIPS Simulator and Shell implementation. In the 3rd and 4th grades, I conducted practical software projects by taking ""Domain Analysis and SW Design"", ""Software Engineering"", and project subjects. While taking the courses, I realized that software engineering specification/documentation such as Requirements, Design, Testing, and Maintenance is very important, not just to develop them. In addition, I developed the SmartHome IoT application in the Mobile Programming class. I used Raspberry Pi to operate the sensor and implemented the function to control it on mobile through Bluetooth connection. I remember that I was very excited and implemented a practical project for the first time. In fact, I created a model house and released a Demo application. ""A rare tester part-time job."" I have worked at a mobile game company for about two months. This company makes mobile games that simulate dramas. My duties were planning work assistant and testing. I personally looked at the scenarios and planned the screen to see if the flow of the game matches the scenario, and looked for any bugs. Due to the nature of the game company that produces dramas based on them, we had to update the conference chapters that were aired every week, and we had to run all of the two chappers' tests for a week. It was not easy to run and report all the tests in time, and then retest the new games that were supplemented. However, it was nice to be able to correct the errors I found and to release the finished version every week so that I could immediately see user reviews. Through this part-time job experience, I was able to feel the difficulty and interest of QA work at the same time. I knew that there were separate development and QA jobs because I usually like games, but I thought it was just a testing job. However, when I looked up the specific work of the QA team, I realized that it was not just a job to test. Quality Assistance (QA) is a quality control team. It is responsible for determining the quality of the product as a whole if the project fits the purpose. Test engineers (TE) are part of QA. They often misunderstand QA as TE, which is an activity that reveals defects in SW. On the other hand, QA is also required much more ability than simple TE because it also serves to prevent further damage by informing the planning team of the problem if there is a problem with planning. I think this job requires empathy, observation, and programming skills.From a user's point of view, we should look at whether this SW is valuable or uncomfortable, and think about how to give feedback to developers, and what purpose planners had. For me, the QA job that requires these skills has come to me attractively, and I have an aspiration to work in the QA job. ""Power of positive mind: the ability not to be afraid of new knowledge and skills."" My strength is positive mind. These are the values I gained from my parents' teaching. This soon came to me as a new environment or positive recklessness in studying. I thought it was an essential competency in the IT job, where trends change day by day, and this mind gave me a good opportunity while majoring in SW. I have experience as an undergraduate intern at the Computer Vision Lab in order to study in a field I have not been on summer vacation in my third year. I had no knowledge of computer vision and told you that I wanted to visit the professor and learn, and as a result, I implemented the 'Poisson matting' thesis while working as an intern for two months. The thesis was implemented using OpenCV. This project was carried out by studying the basics of image processing after reading a thesis for the first time in my life. In fact, when I saw the result and held the final seminar in front of professors and students, I felt a great sense of pride. I used the computer vision knowledge I learned without stopping here in my project. While producing ""MakeApp"" for the ""Software Engineering"" class, I shared my computer vision knowledge with my team members and used Face Recognition and Aging Algorithm while producing a matching application for missing children as a graduation project. Through this, I was able to learn that diverse experiences and knowledge can be the source of ideas for new projects. ""Dance: Leadership and perseverance."" I like to dance. Since high school, I have performed at festivals and worked in a dance club in college. The dance club, which entered the third grade late, has influenced me a lot. It is a club that divides teams every quarter. When I first joined the club, I did not claim to be a leader. It is because I liked dancing, but I did not have the confidence to be good. However, while doing activities every quarter, I practiced individual and team practice by dividing my break time outside of studying time. As a result, there were members who looked at me with good eyes, and I was told that they always made it possible to do movements that were not possible in the previous practice in the next practice. Seeing those words and myself growing, I gained confidence and led the team by claiming to be the leader in the activities I conducted later. The biggest problem while leading the team was small talk and the team members' morale during practice. Since it was not a professional activity, the boundaries between personal conversations and opinions on dance were often broken. There were times when we only talked and the practice ended. So, I accurately conveyed to my team members the opinion to spend the 2 hours of comfortable practice, but properly practicing. In addition, it was common for team members' morale to decline as the practice period increased. To this end, I made a practice plan so that I would always set today's goals so that I would not be lazy in practice until the final stage. Through these efforts, the team members said that I let them know that the role of the leader is important in the dance club as well. It was a hobby, but I was always thinking, 'Once you started, let's do it properly.' In my personal hobby, I was able to find myself growing more confident in recognition of my leadership and tenacious efforts."
"""Data is the Competitiveness of Lotte Department Store"" As a statistics major, I had many opportunities to confirm that using data could effectively predict future outcome values. Naturally, I realized the importance of data-based decision-making, and I developed my statistical analysis capability by conducting big data analysis directly in projects and competitions in class. When I was exploring my career path, I also thought that I wanted to do something that produced meaningful results by deriving meaningful results from actual data. I think it is another opportunity now that all online commerce besides other department stores are competing with each other due to digitalization. Lotte Department Store has an overwhelming number of stores and customer data in the department store industry. The opportunity to obtain a variety of high-quality data by utilizing the time customers spend at department stores is open, and by using marketing that integrated data through omnichannel, I will gain unparalleled competitiveness. I applied because I wanted to use my statistical capabilities to gain marketing insights and create innovation with Lotte Department Store's data. ""Activity and challenging spirit nurtured in other countries"" I have established values that actively challenge myself from my childhood experience in the United States. When I was in the second grade of elementary school, I moved to the U.S. and entered a local school. I had a hard time adjusting because not only was there an Asian in the whole school, but I was not able to speak English at all. However, I first came forward, asked for help, and tried to speak to other friends in short English to learn English within a short period of a year. I made English my strength by taking advantage of the urgency of the situation that could have left me as a trauma, and now I have developed my skills enough to be mistaken for Korean by my foreign friends. Having crossed a big barrier in my childhood gave me the confidence to challenge myself without hesitation. I am often told by people around me that I am versatile. However, the truth is that rather than being outstanding, I bumped into various fields with the mind of 'Shouldn't I be persistent?' It was my first time to study finance, but with the will to learn, I obtained related certificates and worked at a financial engineering association. I had never dealt with Photoshop before, but I was in charge of producing posters for the association, and I made posters overnight through Photoshop while taking lectures. Based on my R and SAS coding skills, I also challenged programs such as Python and Excel VBA, conducted sessions, and used them for work. I booked a plane right away to learn Chinese and studied there alone for a month. In this way, you won't be afraid of challenges for innovation and ability improvement at work. ""Shortening work hours with coding capabilities"" When I was working as an intern at a life insurance company, I had the experience of saving time by organizing a simple program. At that time, I had no experience in practice and lacked financial knowledge. However, it was during the audit period, so it was difficult for department members to devote time to taking over. I found something I could actively do. One of the main tasks of the department was to find the payment capacity ratio, which required 1000 simulations to be rotated through VBA coding. It took about half a day for the existing code to run out, so I couldn't use the PC, and it was common for other departments working on related tasks to waste time waiting for the results. Interested in coding, I suggested that I would revise the code faster if you could help department members understand the simulation process. I was worried that my motivation to contribute would harm, but I worked with that much responsibility. With the help of department members, I studied the calculation process and studied VBA based on my R coding skills. For a week, I shortened the time by about four hours by changing the data into a matrix and modifying the code by using a loop statement. I greatly reduced working hours as I could check the simulation results when I needed them before leaving work without having to wait until the next day. I felt that I could make a practical contribution to the practice by actively utilizing what I learned at school. I learned that I could achieve better results through collaboration that demonstrated my individual capabilities, and I promised to be active in any organization. ""Winning a Big Data Analysis Contest with a Creative Approach"" In order to become a big data analysis expert, I learned how to access data through examples, and I gained experience by conducting analysis projects myself in classes and competitions. My strength is that I can understand the principles of analysis and take a creative approach. For male beauty marketing in the Big Data Analysis Competition, we analyzed the card and app usage history and survey results of 115,854 respondents with R and SAS. Each respondent should have expressed their interest in beauty, but at first, the number of items they use was used as a variable. However, this did not accurately reflect the difference between the items. Compared to men who use two basic products, skin lotion and sunscreen, men's interest in beauty is rather low. I came up with a new idea to score each item by assigning its frequency reciprocal as importance. Products that are frequently used gave low scores, and products that are not common, such as BB cream, gave high scores to measure the degree of interest in beauty. After that, we conducted a correlation analysis through pre-processing, and received the second prize in recognition of the performance and creativity of the model. In this way, I can achieve better results by trying various methods according to my intuition rather than inserting data into a fixed analysis frame. The weakness I have about my job is that the analysis tool I mainly use is limited to R. However, whenever I had the opportunity to overcome this, I used other programs such as Python and VBA, and I checked my ability to adapt quickly as needed. After joining the ""data expert that achieves innovation"", I will sincerely learn the marketing and sales strategy establishment process of Lotte Department Store and grow into a data expert.This is due to the fact that we need to know exactly how we are doing in order to drive progressive changes. By clustering customer data, we will anticipate the effectiveness or sales of promotions based on the business district, timing, and customer characteristics. I would also like to plan events and promotions with insights obtained by analyzing how consumption of a particular product tends to lead to other consumption. I would also like to challenge tweezers marketing that use customized events or discounts depending on the customer. In this way, we will strategically activate sales and confirm the results. After cultivating my expertise, I want to encourage customers to use online services at the same time and use department stores as a larger data platform to expand the scope of analysis. We will strengthen Lotte Department Store's position by innovative attempts that follow the trend of the times, such as conducting analysis using travel paths within department stores."
"When I was in college, I always led the team by taking on the team leader when I was working on team projects. It was possible because the team members highly appreciated my ability to take charge of the project with a responsibility, not because they wanted strong leadership and power. I did the project by listening to all the team members' opinions, drawing the best choice, and sharing the work according to each other's abilities through collaboration without falling out. Naturally, when I work on other projects, I take on the team leader, and the team leader has always been my role. I have experience as an assistant in a major course in team projects at the suggestion of the professor in the project class I took before. The assistant was a role in which all students had to work with fair principles and standards, and I tried to keep it and have faith in the students. In addition, I tried to become a friendly assistant who can approach students comfortably by asking questions about things they do not know, rather than a heavy position to assist the professor. With the above example, I want to become a talented person who shines in Dow technology. I believe that the value of a company is created by customers, and I believe that Dow technology, which provides technology development and services based on customer trust and approaches customers, is the ideal management method of the company. This was a big reason for me to choose Dow technology. As above, I chose a company with the goal of making a program that many people use comfortably and pleasantly. I want to be the best developer who provides the best services to customers with the flow of the process and the understanding learned while using financial programs. I want to work at Dow technology, which aims at customer trust and trust, as a talented person who shines the first step toward becoming the best developer. I have built up my competence to perform my duties with differentiated expertise by communicating with customers with trust with a customer-centered mind at Dow technology. As my project, I proceeded with a project to modify the school industry-academic management system site to meet the needs of users and add new functions. The project was carried out through communication with the team members who are working on the project together and through meetings with professors and students who are users. Although there were team members, they had different roles, so it was necessary to trust each other and proceed with different things. We tried to build trust through communication, let them know when there was something they didn't know, and build expertise as well. From the experience above, through meetings and communication, I developed the ability to draw and reflect active opinions for the development of the program, and I also improved my development capabilities such as JAVA and JSP. I want to contribute to the world with reliable technologies and services in Dow Technology by utilizing this strength. I have many acquaintances around me who invest in stocks through heroics, such as my parents and brothers. When we talk about investment, we also share our thoughts on the inconveniences or desired functions when using trading programs such as HTS and MTS. I wanted to create a better home trading program by addressing these customer requests. The owner of the program is the customer who is the user, and it should be provided so that all functions within the program can be easily and conveniently used. I applied to Dow Technology to become a solver in finding and solving improvement plans from the customer's point of view. I want to work in the financial development job within Dow Technology. OOOO provides customer autonomy and convenience through the Open API+ service. However, it is not easy for the general public to see and develop, so it shows that the program created by specific developers is purchased and used separately. The program should allow users to use all functions as easily and conveniently as possible. However, as mentioned earlier, the use of Open API+ services is difficult for most customers to use because there are many complicated parts. Therefore, I want to improve the functionality I want to use with just one touch. I am dreaming of my plan with the network carrier path. Currently, I have a dream to develop HTS and MTS for my financial IT work, but I want to find and develop a job that suits me the most and can function to me because the job I want may be different from the job I want."
"When I was a developer at OO, I was in charge of developing an integrated POS program for stores operated by the company. When I was working on the project, a total of three people, one senior developer and one designer, teamed up to carry out the project. Since it is a program operated by an actual store and it is difficult to make a program that recognizes and performs electronic devices such as a barcode reader and a printer, I decided that it would be better to produce it together. I had a meeting every morning after going to work to discuss the structure of the program, and discussed the composition and design of the page with the designer. The designer was in charge of simple front-end and design, and I was in charge of DB back-end and the rest of the front-end, and the senior developer was in charge of compatibility with external devices and back-end. As the systematic project progressed, the program was developed smoothly and distributed and used, but there were some problems in the actual use. ""Resolving the lack of reflection of user requirements"" Each user had a different language, and when using the function, it did not properly accommodate the user's needs, such as adding new functions that were different from what we thought and deleting unnecessary functions. So, I asked the store manager for help to accept the needs of program users and to gather opinions on what needs to be revised and what new functions they wanted and deliver them. His teamwork greatly helped him carry out the project. Whenever there was a change within the program, we held a meeting with the manager and produced the program through coordination so that users could use it as conveniently as possible. As a result, unnecessary modifications were noticeably reduced, and development progressed to meet the needs of users and showed great efficiency in usability. We distributed the ""automatic update through robot"" program and stored it in the headquarters database immediately when sales occurred in the store while in use. However, developers have to modify themselves because employees are inexperienced in using it or difficult for them to cope with new situations such as exchange and refund. So we created an additional deadline button to collectively transfer the database through the button at the end of the day, and added a bot program to automatically insert the data into the database after the deadline by creating a bot so that the staff could import the data even if they did not press the deadline button. I felt that collaboration with others was very important in this project, and I learned that coordination of disagreements with team members was also one of the great importance in the project's progress. I also learned that it was very important for customers who used the program, and I felt proud that it has established itself as a program that I still use today. I was interested in blockchain technology and cryptocurrency. I had a hobby of getting information from various forum sites, doing business on exchanges frequently, and I wanted to create a site containing information on cryptocurrency and an automatic trading bot. So I set the goal of achieving these two projects and started the process. The trading site was made of JSP maven, and I received data using the public APIs of domestic and foreign exchanges, and put the data I needed while trading cryptocurrency, such as market price, exchange rate premium, and change, on the site. It was not difficult to create a web project, but there were many difficulties in creating an automatic trading bot. People create trading bots using the private API of the exchange called Binance, which is the most used in the world in cryptocurrency transactions, but it is difficult to obtain only the information they want because all the documents used are written in English and it is complicated, so I thought about whether they use other exchanges' APIs. However, since it is an exchange that I use and it is the most used by people, I have a strong will to create using the Binance API. So, I proceeded slowly with the development with help through mail with the developer of Binance and communication with other developers on Telegram. Eventually, I completed creating a bot that allows designated and market prices to buy and sell over a month. What I was able to complete while working on the project was the result of constant communication. If I had looked for materials by myself, I could have quit because I was tired of difficulties, and I could have lost my will quickly because of the project I started voluntarily. However, I overcame difficulties through communication with others. Through this experience, I learned that constant passion and effort are not betrayed, and I want to prove and develop my work at Naver. People tend to use Google more often than Naver in search of the desired data. I also use Google a lot, and there are two main reasons. First, I felt that Google searched for related sites from various sites, but Naver brought in information that many people did not want, such as blogs and dictionary meanings, first. Second, information posts for commercial purposes are posted first on Naver. When you search for an item or product, advertising comes up through PowerLink, and components that lead to the sale of goods through Naver shopping are ranked high. The above two problems are good for commercial purposes, but I think the UI needs to be improved as Naver, which has the title of the best portal site in Korea. The main_pack within the search screen page is relatively narrow compared to sub_pack div, so there is no data under the search word ranking and news topic in sub_pack, but I thought it was inappropriate for space utilization as it remained empty. This is not a big problem due to external issues, but I wanted to correct it because it was inconvenient for customers using Naver sites."
"Kookmin Bank is my financial partner. I have been using Kookmin Bank for more than 10 years, starting with the first account opening. I also used a mobile bank that is easy to use with other banks, but the bank that has been with me so far is Kookmin Bank. As I used mobile banking and an application that is easy to operate, I felt strongly that Kookmin Bank prioritized customers. Also, I will now lead the way to provide customers with many services that I have received while looking at Kookmin Bank, which has set economic concepts and secured assets safely. During development, the most important thing is 'Can users use all services without difficulty while using the program?' As the purpose of the program is to provide convenient services to users, I try to make it comfortable and accessible. I will always put my customers first, thinking about how to get services more comfortable and trustworthy, and act. Many customers will come to companies that are working with customer priority in mind. I will try to make more and more customers use all of Kookmin Bank's services more conveniently. I got a working holiday visa and worked as a web full-stack developer in Germany. At this time, I was in charge of developing a POS program for stores operated by a company, and I played a role in adding and supplementing functions that users wanted or uncomfortable in the calculation program. The people who used the program were employees of the same company, but they were just like customers as they used my program. I received a lot of help in program production by adding additional functions that I sometimes request and supplementing them with feedback if there was any inconvenience in the functions I made. As I added new functions, I realized that sufficient conversation and feedback with users were important as I saw cases where functions made that I thought would be convenient for users to use caused inconvenience to users. In addition, it was very rewarding to fix their inconveniences with my hands and make them comfortable. I think the best customer service is by far constant customer communication. For example, let's say someone wants to start a stock business, and they want to start by watching a lecture from a paid stock trader. There will be many personal conditions in choosing a trader, but the most important of them is communication between the trader and the stock investor. Traders who always receive questions and opinions, even if they are a little lacking in skills, are more popular than traders who attract customers by telling them only when to buy or sell certain stocks. In the example above, the trader is Kookmin Bank, and the stock investor is the customer. Customers will always open their minds to a company that accepts their requests and solves problems quickly. The lack of communication lowers the customer's credibility and reduces access to the company. Another example is the KakaoTalk consultation service. In the past, most customer centers used to have inquiries through phone calls, visits, and e-mails. However, now most of them have KakaoTalk consultation services. The KakaoTalk consultation service has enabled many customers to make inquiries smoothly. There may also be many reasons for this, but the number one reason by far is fast and easy communication. The fact that inquiries can be received with just one message through KakaoTalk without the hassle of processing has come as a great advantage to customers, and KakaoTalk counseling service is establishing itself as a type of larger customer center as many customers are satisfied and using it. This is also a form of service that considers constant communication with customers, and communication with customers plays a big role in the image of the company. I always try to provide better services through constant communication with customers. When I was a web developer at a German company, I worked with other developers on a project to create a new company homepage. It was not a project that gave enough time to one person, but a project that consisted of two designers and two developers to complete in a short period of time, so it was a project that worried me a lot, which was relatively unskilled unlike other people. Since the project had to be completed in a given short time without any problems, everyone approached the project carefully and planned. We had a meeting every morning before starting work, shared our roles, shared each other's situations through messengers, and coded. First, we conceived the structure of the program and built the database, and the developers focused on the back-end. While joining the company and working as a web developer, I was only responsible for maintaining and repairing the programs I was using at the time, and I was nervous about starting a new project from scratch, and I made frequent mistakes, but I gained great experience and learned a lot from the project with the idea that everyone was not in a hurry and slowly worked from the basics. It was a project that was carried out by several people, but it was done in a way that each person developed their part separately, so I had to judge and develop the method of coding and the module of use. This personal judgment was given responsibility, but it was helpful for responsibility and self-development because we asked for opinions through communication with team members and conducted it by searching the Internet as much as possible. In addition, there were often times when opinions were divided at meetings with team members, but I also learned how to respect each other's thoughts, embrace each other, and lead the story so that I could achieve the best results. This project is the most memorable one, where I learned a strong confidence that I could complete all the future projects by completing a given big practical project safely for the first time, and I could feel the importance of teamwork with my whole body and learn open thinking through collecting opinions with my team members.I think the most important competency for bankers in response to the rapidly changing financial environment is to respond quickly. They pursue and advance fast and easy use, but as a side effect, there are many problems such as security and program errors. I cannot guarantee that all problems will be blocked at the source, but I think a quick response is always possible. When a problem occurs, first, a quick apology to customers, calmly identify the cause and solution of the problem, inform customers in a transparent manner, and respond quickly to the problem, which can be an opportunity to increase trust in customers. I think the most important competency for bankers is to respond quickly to crises. I was interested in blockchain technology and cryptocurrency ""problem solving through quick response"". I created an automatic transaction bot using a homepage and a specific exchange API that informs the market price and information of cryptocurrency. There was a meeting where we shared information and talked while investing in cryptocurrency, and I shared that if anyone wanted to use the automatic transaction bot program I made on my own, even though I was not good enough, I would like to use it. While I was developing with opinions from people using my program, such as inconveniences and additional points, there was a time when the program failed due to changes in the API. If it was a program that I used alone and developed, there was no problem, but in fact, it was an important moment for other acquaintances to trade money, so a big problem could occur. However, once I learned that the problem had occurred, I quickly identified the problem and canceled the linked private API key of the users to block automatic transactions within the program, and solved the problem by modifying the program. It was a situation that could have caused a big problem, but as a result of responding calmly without panicking, I was able to solve the error without any problems. This experience made me feel the importance of quick response with my whole body, and I also learned that I had to take a great responsibility in developing as a program distributor."
"'Development Through Passion and Competition.' I liked to compete in good faith with my friends. Rather than developing without a goal, I enjoyed a simple bet with my friends, or a sense of accomplishment when I set a goal to be the first place and paid off. Even if it is not always about studying, I have developed by enjoying competition even when playing games or exercising. I acted with the idea of setting goals and improving myself, not being determined to beat others. Also, it became an opportunity for me to passionately focus on something. The above sentence, 'It is better to regret after doing it than not doing it and regretting it' is my motto. I have always lived in a challenging attitude based on my motto. Due to my timid personality when I was a child, I often overstepped without even challenging many things I wanted to do. As I grew up, I decided to change my personality thinking that if I lived a passive life and hid myself, I would not be able to do anything, so I tried to live a positive and challenging life. I have used small payments a lot while using the Internet. Many people, not just me, have used the multi-day micropayment system and I still continue to use it. People recognize and do not use the payment system as a 'multi-day' system, but they are all familiar with it. This has given me a passion to work in multiple days. I wanted to develop a system that many people unconsciously use comfortably, rather than being rewarded with doing tasks that others know. My value as a developer is to create a program that many people use easily and conveniently. I want to develop it by thinking from the user's point of view how our program users can use our services faster and more easily. I applied because I wanted to realize this dream in multiple days. I am confident in web programming. When I was in college, I started making a basic homepage using HTML, and I dreamed of becoming a web programmer while learning JSP. However, I went to Germany for a working holiday to experience as a developer because I thought that theoretical classes and simple projects taught in school could not build my skills. When I was a developer in Germany, I was in charge of maintenance of the company's homepage written in JSP. Developing additional function pages and improving design The front-end was mainly developed to enhance the development capability of becoming a web developer. In addition, we carried out a project to develop an integrated POS program for stores operated by the company using the PHP Laravel framework. Although I did not have much experience in the PHP language, I was in charge of the task because it was not much different from the JSP I was confident in, and there were not many differences in the development languages such as JAVASCRIPT and HTML. As a different experience, I worked on the maintenance of the school website. I improved my ability to understand the code by looking at the code written by all developers, and by adding new functions and correcting errors. Through communication with the team members who are working on the project together and through meetings and meetings with professors and students who are users, we improved our ability to proceed with the project. This became an opportunity to increase the sense of responsibility for the development program and the creativity and conductivity of adding functions. In addition, I improved the efficiency of the project by writing a guide document for the developer who will be in charge of me next. Of course, it was difficult to skillfully solve all the tasks in both experiences, but I improved my skills by studying separately after work. Through the above experience, I have improved my web development capabilities. There are two main dreams and goals I want to pursue in Danal. The development of a cryptocurrency called Paycoin led the practical cryptocurrency market to enable payment as well as in-kind through the development of a cryptocurrency called Paycoin. For people who previously thought cryptocurrency was just speculation, the start of Danal's blockchain business showed the possibility that cryptocurrency can be applied to real life and open up a faster and more convenient payment system than today. I want to continue my challenge and work on blockchain. With interest in blockchain, I wanted to study cryptocurrency-related research, write a paper through specific cryptocurrency research, create an automatic trading bot through the API of the Binance exchange, and later work on blockchain-related work. The achievement I am trying to show is to change the perception of cryptocurrency and instill in people that it is the introduction of technology that is far faster and more convenient than the existing payment system. I want to let you feel that it is a technological advancement, not a temporary speculation like Bubble Dotcom. Small payment services are every day. Many people have used the Internet or mobile phone micropayments, but many people do not know that the company of the service they used is every day. I want to instill an awareness that these people's perceptions are convenient and easy because they are not just a means of paying, but they are also provided by Multiple. Technology is very important, but promoting it is also a very important role in the development of the company. Danal is moving toward the role of financial institutions by expanding the credit rating business using big data. Regarding the big data analysis and credit rating business, I want to show results in creating a reliable company that pays with trust because people use multiple payment systems to pay while using multiple systems. I will grow as a communicative developer. I will be a developer who communicates and grows with my team members, not just a developer who has improved development capabilities. Good ideas and creativity are not derived only from the competence of a specific person. I come up with creative and innovative ideas after a lot of people put their heads together and think. I'm not a person who is proud of my development capabilities, but I'm trying to be a developer who is humble to myself and collects other people's opinions to provide the best service to customers who use the service every day.The constant communication and development between developers through code review will serve as an opportunity for both me and my team members to grow, and I will become a person who actively utilizes this culture to grow. Also, the person who uses our service is the customer. The element that makes a company will be a developer who develops into a service that customers want by focusing on the customer's sound, focusing on the idea of customers. I will become a person who develops through communication with customers and communication with team members."

Due to my timid personality as a child, I often overstepped without even challenging many things I wanted to do. However, as I grew up, I thought that if I lived a passive life and hid myself, I would not be able to do anything, so I decided to change my personality and tried to live a positive and challenging life. I have also always lived in a challenging attitude based on my motto. There were many challenges, and I would like to talk about myself through two of them. ""Don't let it work."" I had a tablet, which did not support versions 2.3 or later through OS upgrades. Later on, April 4.When version 0 came out, I wanted to use the new version, but I thought buying a new tablet was the only way to use it, so I searched the Internet to see if there was any other way. At that time, I saw an article that the 4.0 version can be used with my Galaxy Tab if I distribute version 4.0 within an Internet cafe and manually update it through loading. Although loading was not illegal, I realized that A/S support was not possible after proceeding with loading, but I thought it would be necessary to improve the speed, so I put it into action. ""Can I do well? Let's try it first."" When I was in college, I received excellent grades in programming language subjects such as C and JAVA, but I wanted to experience practice because I thought it would be difficult to strengthen my programming skills with theories and small projects learned at school. I was issued a working holiday visa in Germany and joined the company as a web developer of a logistics company in Frankfurt through a job site. It was not easy to work abroad due to my lack of experience and living abroad, but my biggest decision to come to Germany was the will to return with a lot of experience and learning. Challenging anything is not always the right attitude. My disadvantage is that I am impatient and start with overflowing passion without being fully prepared, and sometimes fail. However, I am doing everything with my motto, ""It's better to do it and regret than not regret it"" and passion and spirit to do things that may be impossible and adversely affect me. My strengths and weaknesses are haste, which is the back of passion and spirit, just like cause and effect. However, I try to become a person who hides darkness by reducing haste, which is my weakness, by adding constant effort and passion. Through the experience below, I would like to tell you about how I turned failure into success with my efforts and passion. I was interested in blockchain technology and cryptocurrency technology, so I studied and invested. At that time, there were often users who used automatic transaction programs, but I also wanted to create an automatic transaction bot. The automatic trading bot was created using the private API of the exchange called Binance, which has the highest volume in the world, and I thought it was difficult to obtain only the information I wanted due to the complicated usage documents, but I was strongly willing to create it using the Binance API in that it is an exchange I use and an exchange that people use the most. So I proceeded with the development with help through mail with the developer of Binance and communication with other developers on Telegram. Eventually, I completed creating a bot that allows designated and market prices to buy and sell over a month. This experience gave me confidence that if I work without giving up with persistence, I can solve difficult tasks, and I gained courage to overcome without worrying about future tasks. A life of complacency has not progressed. I have tried, challenged, and improved for a better life than now. Although the major classes I learned in school did not do well, I thought I could not express myself with simple numbers, so I made it important to make and experience it myself. ""Conflict? Is there anything you need to understand, be considerate, and coordinate your opinions?"" Looking at the friends around you who are in a relationship, the reason for the breakup was ""we are not compatible."" It is perfectly natural, and it is a cowardly excuse. We all have different thoughts, habits, and personalities. It is only natural that two people are not compatible. You should acknowledge the differences, respect each other, and show understanding and deal with them. I have no experience in fighting with a lover so far. First, I provide information to get to know me, such as my lifestyle habits and actions, and listen to the other person's opinions and their lives as well. Also, I try to coordinate the differences and dislike parts. You may think it is very ideal behavior and nonsense, but I have lived like it until now and will continue to do so. It is the same with friends and co-workers. Instead of concluding that ""That person doesn't fit me, we can't get along,"" we should meet with a mutual understanding and respect. However, even if we know each other well, a conflict can happen at any time. When a conflict arises, I first listen to the other person's thoughts, identify and understand what caused the problem with me. And I solve the problem by talking with the other person. Also, when there is a conflict of opinion, I like to take time to appeal each other's opinions and discuss them with better opinions. My goal in life is to become a developer who can confidently answer the question 'What did you do?' when someone asks you in the future, 'I created and still use these programs.' With the idea that tigers die and leave leather, developers die and leave programs, KB Kookmin Card is about to take the step toward becoming the best developers."
"I want to work on developing Shinsegae I&C's overall distribution system and POS system. I tried to use it a few times because I could easily see unmanned devices around me, but it was difficult to use it due to different UI and uncomfortable UX for each POS device. Shinsegae I&C is striving for convenient payment in stores through the development and introduction of deep learning-based artificial intelligence and cloud-based POS. My goal as a developer is to create a program that people can use easily and conveniently. Shinsegae I&C's goal of striving to develop a payment culture through SSG Pay was consistent with my goal and supported. I have tried to become a well-understood developer who can quickly input Shinsegae I&C's S/W job through the development of POS systems and learning the structure of logistics systems. I want to have an opportunity to grow by looking at places like Shinsegae I&C that are running toward the happiness and convenience of customers by becoming a talented person who shines on Shinsegae I&C with a passionate and overcoming difficulties. I want to play a role in developing and operating POS systems. When I was an intern, I was working on a POS system development project and my relationship with POS began. This experience is a differentiated ability and experience that I can do better than others in itself, and I would like to talk about it. The project I was in charge of was to develop an integrated POS system for stores run by a company. A total of three people, including a designer who can develop a little front-end, another developer who is in charge of compatibility with external devices such as a printer, a barcode reader, and the rest of the front, end, and DB, were in charge of the project. It was created with the PHP Laravel framework, and the development tool was jointly developed through ATOM and Github. All sales data are stored in the company's integrated DB, so first, a POS system with a basic framework that can be used in all stores was developed, and then UI/UX changes and accounting logic were implemented and introduced according to the style of each store. In the above development method, a system was established so that it could be used immediately when a new store opens, enabling rapid development. In addition, a bot program was created separately and automatically stored in the headquarters DB and the local DB according to the set time and the amount of processed data to prevent data loss. With the development capabilities and customer-centered minds gained from the above experience, I will skillfully perform the tasks that Shinsegae I&C will take on in the future. I was very interested in blockchain technology and cryptocurrency. I had a hobby of obtaining information from various forum sites and trading on exchanges, and I wanted to create a site containing information on cryptocurrency and an automatic transaction bot. So I set the goal of achieving these two projects and started the process. The site was written in JSP through the maven framework. It could have been made simple by using the template, but I wanted to make it all with my own strength, so I made all the designs myself. In addition, I made it by considering the structure of MVC and the operation of an optimized homepage. I received data through public APIs of domestic and foreign exchanges, and included the data I needed while trading, such as market prices, exchange rate premiums, and changes, on the site. It was easy to create the web, but creating automatic trading bots had many difficulties. I created a trading bot using the private API of an exchange called Binance, but it was difficult to obtain only the information I wanted because the API usage documents were complicated. However, I wanted to create it using the Binance API because it is an exchange that people use the most and I use. So, first, we built the necessary dependencies through API information, and developed it with help through e-mail with Binance developers and communication with developers on social media. Eventually, we completed creating a bot that allows designated and market prices to buy and sell over a month. I think it was possible to complete the project thanks to constant communication. If I had looked for materials by myself, I could have quit after getting tired of the difficulties, and my will could have quickly disappeared due to the project I started voluntarily. However, I have overcome difficulties through communication with others. Through this experience, I learned that constant passion and effort do not betray, and I also want to prove and develop my work at Shinsegae I&C with passion."
"Watching the personal information leakage incident at domestic telecommunication companies and credit card companies a few years ago, I was amazed that such large companies also leak information, but I felt a lot of inconvenience due to the large amount of spam texts. Also, while implementing the user management system using the database and the access control system according to the user in the OO education center, I came to feel the importance of the security system that I took for granted. If I become a member of a AhnLab, I collect information on places where the user's personal information is registered and make a list to manage the advertisement and service reception of each site. Even if personal information is leaked from somewhere else, I want to become a security developer who can block spam text messages or emails from places that the user has never signed up or visited before and track where the information was leaked from. Recently, seven companies, including the three mobile telecommunication companies and Samsung Electronics, have developed mobile certificate apps based on blockchain. The goal of this application is to submit graduation and transcripts, and to make it easy to authenticate anywhere through a smartphone without having to carry a student or ID card. In an era where everything is smart, this technology will provide convenience to many people, but it will require much stronger security because the application contains all kinds of personal information of users. It would be more effective if it was based on a private blockchain in which only certain organizations or individuals can participate, but I think additional security solutions are needed. Also, even if a specific certificate is issued through the application, it is not stored directly in a smartphone, but if it is a method that requires a company's server to request it every time when using or transmitting it, and undergo personal authentication every time, such as an official certificate, I think the approval system between companies will become complicated. When I was in my fourth year of college, I participated in an M2M competition with my friends under the theme of Electronic Arms with Four Functions. The problem occurred on the day of the evaluation. While I was going to the evaluation site to finish setting up and testing, the board burned down due to a new motor drive, so I couldn't replace it with the existing one. Since we didn't have an extra board, we prepared for the evaluation by taking measures to demonstrate without a board through an emergency meeting. Although I couldn't show direct action, one of my team members faithfully explained the hardware, and I, as a software representative, explained the operation structure by code, and finished the demonstration safely by showing the demonstration video of the project, which was the motif of the electronic artificial hand, and the test video taken by the other team members. As a result, even though I didn't show my movements, I received a pretty good evaluation and was able to win the Encouragement Award. Through this experience, I have come to realize the importance of teamwork, the extra materials, and the need for demonstration videos. ""Successful human relationships."" I think I have been good at human relationships. Due to my introverted personality during my school days, I became a habit of caring for others, and as many people consider me well, I have become close to various people through clubs and student meetings, and I have maintained a continuous relationship. ""Teamwork master"" I have never had anyone leave or have a disagreement in the group activities so far. Although I have been in charge of SW development in the project, I have actively accepted the opinions of the team members, and I approached the team members first so that they could get acquainted quickly in the group project, and I was able to do well without anyone getting in a free ride by leading the distribution of roles and meetings first. ""Multilateral Knowledge"" I have laid the foundation for IT-related knowledge from hardware to software to programming through my college curriculum, and I have expanded my expertise by learning web programming, Android, and DBMS through my professional curriculum. I think this accumulated knowledge will be of great help in creating various security systems."
"""Growing Up: The Responsibility I Learned by Regret and Reflection."" After graduating from high school, my father faced me and said, ""You are now an adult, so you have to take responsibility for what you have done. I won't say much if you marry tomorrow."" At that time, I thought lightly about and passed on the responsibilities my father was talking about, but there were so many opportunities to rethink them. The problems that occurred due to short thoughts and irresponsibility such as part-time jobs and group assignments were never trivial and made me look back on myself. However, as someone said that you only grow up after entering the military, community life in the military became an opportunity to correct wrongs before. After being discharged from the military, I returned to college by acting responsibly for my job, changing the perspective of my surroundings, and getting an opportunity to work as an assistant in the professor's class or be recommended as an assistant in a department facility. Through these experiences, I will responsibly complete the given task by dedicating myself. When you proceed with your task of ""Personality: Being meticulous,"" you proceed systematically through plans. When I was in charge of the department's facility assistant and managed the equipment, I didn't receive the transfer before, so I started with arranging the warehouse. I attached a cycle for each equipment, organized the items by year, and then documented and managed them. Through this, I was able to manage the equipment for a year without any minor loss of it, and I was able to proceed with the transition without any problems. In this way, I will make a plan for my task, manage it systematically, and show you how I can trust and entrust it. I am timid in terms of ""personality disadvantages: introverted"" interpersonal relationships. If there is a mistake in speaking or something I feel sorry about, the other person's feelings are bothered for a long time. I think it's a disadvantage because excessive worry can cause damage to people around me. In order to solve this problem, I am trying to solve it by telling the other person my concerns and apologizing once again. ""Hobby Activities: Games"" I like to enjoy and analyze games created by the imagination of various people. I like to participate in alpha and beta testers, share information with people, suggest corrections, and enjoy hunting together as a group, such as raid. Perhaps because of this experience, I prefer SRPG, strategy, and RPG games with high degree of freedom. As a graduation work of ""Hotion Recognition Video Call"", a project to transmit emoticons by combining a Leap Motion sensor and a video call was carried out. The goal was to recognize specific finger motions using Leap Motion and to display the designated object on the screen. The main development tools used were Unity 3D, Mono Development, Eclipse, MySQL, and C# and Java. To represent the designated object on the screen, the Leap Motion sensor was linked using Unity 3D and C#, and the video call was implemented using DB interworking and socket communication using Java in Eclipse. However, it was not easy to complete such a project. In the existing initial setting, Leap Motion was to be drawn and transmitted by hand on a drawing board in conjunction with Java to reduce the development tools, but it was changed to C# to improve the visual part of Demo, and the UI was also modified from Java Swing to FX. Although we had to proceed with the new implementation as the design direction changed during the implementation, we were able to build a development environment comfortably based on the data we researched in advance. In addition, the success of the project was due to the experience of closely examining APIs and being able to access them easily even if the language changes. The most important thing I felt while working on a project like this was the importance of the initial design. As the old saying goes, we will be a person who prepares to respond calmly even if it occurs, so that there are no sudden changes in the project."
"""Shinhan DS, a company that meets my standards."" When I choose a company, I see stability and job suitability. I thought that Shinhan DS is the most stable as it belongs to Shinhan Financial Group, a well-known group in Korea. I have decided to apply for the job because I think that the hacking response field among Shinhan DS's information protection projects is appropriate for my ability in the field of analysis of vulnerabilities, penetration tests, security solutions, reverse engineering, and forensics. ""Information security expert recognized by everyone"" My goal after joining the company is to become an information security expert recognized by everyone within three years. To do so, I will make the following efforts. First, I will quickly grasp the relevant job and focus on performance and communication with my team members. From what I have experienced so far, I think it is most efficient to perform tasks through teamwork rather than performing tasks by individuals. Therefore, I will ensure that the organizations harmonize well and always be receptive so that they can adapt quickly. Second, I will acquire a certificate. I will acquire an information security technician, CCNA, etc. Information security is a job that requires not only practical skills but also knowledge of the law, and is capable of quick response and prevention in emergency situations, so we will strive for more and more self-development. As described above, we will become an information security expert who can develop and expand our capabilities with Shinhan DS. 1. Blog address: https://blog.naver.com/OOOO Blog summarized basic information about C language, network, and Linux, and organized about reverse engineering and forensics using Immunity Debugger. Currently, we are working on a program that has similar functions to PEVIEW, a tool that shows the PE structure of the program, using C++. 2. Using reverse engineering tools IDA, Process Monitor, and Bintext, we analyzed the 3.20 virus that paralyzed major networks in Korea on March 20, 2013 and checked the functions used. In addition, we analyzed Lena Reversing Tutorial to improve reverse engineering capabilities. 3. Using FTK Image and Autopsy, we forensics the permanently deleted program through shift+delete. 4. As a graduation work, we implemented IoT smart door using Raspberry Pi. C#, Raspberry Pi 3, Arduino, MJPG-Streamer, and WiFi are used to operate the webcam through source code, and Arduino is implemented to control sound detection sensor, tact switch sensor, and servo motor. And we implemented a function to control Raspberry Pi and Arduino with a serial port using the C# language, and an automatic text messaging function. ""Successful orientation performance by communicating with team members"" We formed a team and prepared it for the orientation band club performance for freshmen in February 2017. However, even though the team members had two weeks of individual practice, they did not practice their songs properly, so they kept making mistakes and missed the beat during the ensemble. We have a performance in two weeks, but we thought that we would be laughed at in front of new students, so we suggested buying food and sharing our opinions with our team members. When I listened to the team member's opinion, I answered that I could do it because the song seemed easy at first, but when I tried to practice, the beat was difficult, so I didn't dare to practice. However, I couldn't tell you because I thought changing the song would damage the team because it was a song I decided after consulting with the team members. After hearing the team member's situation, I gave feedback that they would understand if I told the other team members, and suggested that we set a table with the team members to coordinate our opinions. As a result of talking with the team members, the team members also understood the situation of the conflicted team member, and agreed to practice after selecting a new song that new students would like. And the team members who had conflict practiced even harder, saying they were sorry to change the song because of themselves. As a result, our team successfully wrapped up the performance on the day of orientation and received the greatest cheers during the performance. In order to join Shinhan DS, ""the dream of a security expert who built a security solution,"" I developed the ability of security experts by receiving practical training. So, when I deliberately took the lecture, I listened with more interest in building a security solution. In order to strengthen my skills, I aimed to win the best project award and challenged to build an OOOO security solution. After designing the project, there was a problem. In order to build a security solution, it was necessary to check where the vulnerabilities were, but all of the team members had difficulty because they had not studied about identifying them. So, I gained knowledge by studying with the team members through internet search and questions to the instructor. After that, I divided each part into responsibilities of analyzing vulnerabilities, performing penetration tests, and building security solutions. I asked the instructor about how to analyze various vulnerabilities and how to test penetration, and solved them by referring to the community. Since then, in order to find complement points and to complete a better project, we have improved penetration tests and security solutions with the instructor. All of the team members constantly worked on their part and performed faithfully. As a result, we received the Best Project award in the project presentation. In order to protect the information of the ""Backdoor production experience"", I thought that we should first try the penetration test, which is the opposite nature, so I proceeded with the project of practical training and created the Backdoor by myself. I have experience in creating chat programs using C++ language and socket programming, and I came up with the idea that I could create a backdoor program using this socket programming.The Backdoor program consists of Backdoor_Server and Backdoor_Client. After installing Backdoor_Server on the victim's PC through MetaSploit, the security center notification function on the victim's PC was switched to 'off' when running, so that it does not display the message that the firewall has been released when the firewall is released, and the function that runs automatically when the system starts by registering in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Windows\CurrentVersion\run in regit. And I opened UDP port 533 and made the backdoor_Client wait for the connection. When the backdoor_Client accesses, we created a backdoor that can remotely control the Backdoor_Server installed on the victim's PC with preset commands, ps, dir, get, put, kill, del, cmd, shutdown, and destroy."
"When persuading the other person, I listen to the other person's opinion and think about the situation to persuade them. In February 2017, a team was formed of vocals, guitar, bass, and drums for a college freshman orientation club performance, and a team member who had conflict was in charge of the drum part. We set the ensemble period for one month, and we decided to meet three days a week from four weeks before the performance, and then started practicing. However, it made me and the other team members feel bad because the ensemble itself was impossible because the team member kept making mistakes because he did not practice, and he couldn't match the beat. In order to solve this situation, I bought a meal to a team member and shared opinions, and as a result, I decided to choose a new song, and I practiced hard to show the best performance among orientation performances. Information is collected through questions from the Internet, books, and instructors. An example is the experience of producing a backdoor program. The file consists of Backdoor_Server and Backdoor_Client. After secretly installing Backdoor_Server on the victim's PC, the security center notification function on the victim's PC was switched to 'off' when running, so it does not show the message that the firewall has been released when the firewall is released, and the function that runs automatically when the system starts by registering in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\run is implemented. And I left UDP port 533 open and waited for the connection of Backdoor_Client. When Backdoor_Client accesses, it remotely controls Backdoor_Server with preset commands. The commands were ps, dir, get, put, kill, cmd, shutdown, and destroy. As the president of the club, I wanted to give the members a chance to perform in addition to regular performances, so I prepared a separate performance plan, but the performance plan was disrupted in the middle of the way due to insufficient budget of the club. In order to solve this problem, I asked the seniors in the club, who have been close since they were freshmen, about their willingness to support the performance fee, and they gladly supported me, saying, 'This is nothing for the juniors'. When the budget was met, there was no obstacle to finding a place, and an overall plan was established such as selecting a performance team and selecting a performance song. In addition, I gave feedback from time to time when practicing the performance team, and I tried to show a high-quality performance. As a result, I was able to successfully conclude the performance I planned. Through this experience, I knew that it would be helpful one day if I built up human relationships well on a regular basis, and that if I tried to get closer to the other person, I could get close quickly, and I am trying to become a social person. Through internet search and questions to the instructor, I gained knowledge by studying with my team members. After that, they divided each part and took charge of analyzing vulnerabilities, performing penetration tests, and building security solutions. I asked the instructor about the method of analyzing various vulnerabilities and the penetration test method, and I solved it by referring to the community. After analyzing vulnerabilities using OpenVAS, nmap, we built security solutions using SQL Injection, XSS, CVE vulnerability attacks, SSL Stripes, Backdoor, Linux Kernel privileges increase, password cracking, IPS/IDS, firewall, special character protection script, encryption, salt value application, etc., and we improved penetration tests and security solutions with the instructor to complete better projects. All of the team members worked tirelessly on their part and faithfully performed it. As a result, we won the Best Project Award in the project presentation. When I was a junior at university, I had a team project. It was a project that was made on a free subject using Arduino kits, and other teams said they would purchase the project from the project agency site to get an A+. Our team members also asked us to purchase the project, but the professor asked us to do it creatively and not purchase it, so we decided to make it on our own. The team members said it was not good because they thought the quality would be inferior to other teams, but I convinced them that they would have to follow the rules so that they wouldn't be stabbed in conscience when submitting the project, and the team members eventually agreed. As a result of a lot of hard work, the results began to appear one by one, and we completed satisfactory results. I have experience in analyzing the 3.20 virus that paralyzed major networks in Korea on March 20, 2013, using IDA, Process Monitor, and Bintext, and checking the functions used. When analyzing malicious code, I analyzed it using VMWare because there was a possibility that the computer could be infected, but at first, I analyzed it with the Immunity Debugger, and the virus was automatically executed and the OS was destroyed. Therefore, after analysis using IDA, a static reverting program, we used Process Monitor to check the process of generating, writing, and reading when the virus was working, and using Bintext to check the functions used in the virus. According to the analysis, the 3.20 virus destroyed the OS by loading the library required by the malware, forcibly shutting down the process using the Taskkill command, overwriting certain strings in the partition table, and executing the reboot command shutdown -r -t 0."
"Like M2M mentioned in the past, IoT is changing to not just collecting or exchanging data, but also to analyzing it to create new values. I was interested in an IoT platform such as Tinkerbell operated by Lotte Information and Communication because it conducts all the processes such as connecting objects, collecting, storing, and analyzing data to build an IoT environment. In order to develop and operate such an IoT platform, I have studied various machine learning algorithms including deep learning while attending school, and have studied low-speed, low-cost, and low-power networks that are advantageous for collecting data such as LoRa and long-distance communication. I want to contribute to the development and development of Lotte information and communication's IoT platform based on the knowledge I have studied so far. As a liberal arts student until I graduated from high school, I was a student in the case of going to university through cross-application. I had a great difficulty following the university subjects because I did not learn science subjects while in high school. Eventually, I joined the military and even thought of changing my career to drop out, transfer, or transfer after discharge. However, shortly after being discharged from the military, I learned an anecdote about the construction of Pohang Steel, by a man named Park Tae-joon, by chance. In the meantime, I thought I had simply built a factory, but this was wrong. I was able to build a comprehensive steel mill that seemed difficult due to the will to persuade Japanese companies to obtain capital and technology and the principle of not tolerating a little insolvency. After learning about Chairman Park Tae-joon's anecdote, I thought that I just wanted to run away. I thought about the best way to improve my capabilities, and I felt the need to do things that others are not good at. And although the ability to utilize Linux is a quality that must be acquired, it was appropriate because it was not approached by many students due to vague difficulties. There were many moments when I wanted to give up, but I did not give up one by one and took the courage to challenge myself. As a result, no one in my colleagues was able to handle Linux as much as I was, and my ability, which was behind before joining the military, was ahead of others. As a result, I gained personal honor, recognition from people around me, and confidence that I could do anything, such as receiving the top prize in a software engineering competition. With such a challenging spirit, I want to pursue my ambition by becoming a talented person in Lotte Information and Communication. I was selected for the K-SW Square organized by the IITP and had the opportunity to stay at Purdue University in Indiana for about four months. For me, who had never been abroad for a long time and had never been to the U.S., it was an important experience to be able to experience and understand American culture while working on a project with Purdue University students. For example, while watching soccer and baseball games with Purdue University students, I learned about the differences between American society and our society. We used to listen to different electoral systems, relationships, drinking culture, etc., and tell stories about Korea, and were surprised by the differences. However, the most memorable thing was the way they handled work. As I had to share the work while working on the project, I asked the American student to write the RSA module. He said he would do it, but a few days later he failed to develop it. When I asked him what happened, he said, ""I tried, and I failed. Now it's time to try in a different way. If I fail again, I'll just try again."" For a while, I fell into mannerism and rejected the possibility of failure even when I was working because I was afraid of failure. However, once I heard that, I learned again that it is important to challenge anything. With this mindset, I want to become an engineer who produces results with an invincible spirit of challenge in Lotte Information and Communication. I worked on a team project in a software engineering course, and the goal was to develop an Android app for carpooling with my team members. For the development, we decided to build a server remotely, and I was the only one who could handle Linux, so I was in charge of the backend and server construction, and the rest of the team members divided up to develop Android apps. I've dealt with Linux, but I've never created a web server, and making Android accessible to a remote server was not easy. Nothing was easy, installing the necessary packages, dependence between packages, setting up networks such as IP, and managing firewalls, but I worked hard to solve them one by one with the encouragement of my team members and the bond with them. Programming web servers also took time to develop, focusing on understanding grammar and operation structure. And through frequent communication with colleagues, we made an appointment between Android and web servers to increase development completion and won the top prize. Through the whole process, I gained great experience in building Linux servers and developing the backend of the web or apps, and later, I was able to strengthen my capabilities to the point where I could earn living expenses through outsourced development. However, I am constantly reducing it, but my regret is that I sometimes do not check documents or completeness because I am in a hurry when introducing new libraries or packages. If not carefully introduced, I have to take time to solve new problems caused by the package after introduction, so I am paying more attention to development these days. The era of 5G will soon arrive, which means that it will change the world, not just speed up communication. However, it is not only about speed changing the world, but also about speed reducing latency to 1 millisecond and speeding up responses. If 5G is introduced in earnest and delays are minimized, the data collected from the sensor will be immediately delivered to the trained machine learning program to perform classification, etc., and to quickly transmit results.In other words, it is possible to receive, analyze, and respond immediately by receiving the customer's situation. To this end, I will adapt to the company at the near distance and learn my work, and Lotte will lead the changed world in the 5G era by developing machine learning capabilities, including deep learning, in the far distance."
"""Route search implementation with heuristic"" While studying artificial intelligence, the path search algorithm became very interested in A*, and I challenged to implement the algorithm that improved Theta* by looking for papers on D* and Theta*, etc. A* and Theta*, which are mainly used, were compared, and the development was carried out from early 2018 to December 2019 with the aim of searching a convenient path from a human perspective, not an optimal path for movement. A*, Theta* algorithm was implemented based on the pseudo-code described in the paper. The program was written based on C++, but data structures such as Queue, Stack, and Sort were directly implemented and used without an algorithm header file. A map similar to the actual road was produced using an array, and the result value was derived by changing the road conditions (traffic, accidents, etc.). Through this, we received the excellent thesis award at OOOOO 2018, improved it, and submitted it as a dissertation. After entering the graduate school of ""practice assistant"", I conducted electric and electronic basics, logic circuits, microprocessors, embedded systems, and IoT practice assistant from the 2nd semester of 2017 to 2018. In the electrical and electronic basics, basic elements such as capacitors, transistors, and thermistors were studied, and in the logic circuit, the understanding of logic gates was improved by using simulators such as Verilog and LogicWorks. The microprocessor operated the sensor through the Z-80 assembly and implemented device drivers in the embedded system. In the IoT class, a project focused on object recognition by incorporating OpenCV into Raspberry Pi was carried out with students. ""3D Printer Data Collection"" From April to December 2017, the operating environment and power consumption according to movement of 3D printers were measured using LabView. In an environment such as Korea, power consumption of 3D printers is not a big problem, but it was thought that optimization of power consumption in an environment such as Southeast Asia where factories are established and operate on a large scale was meaningful. By analyzing the G-code, various operations in which the X, Y, and Z axes are the reference were programmed, and power consumption was measured by converting the ambient temperature. I tried to derive the results and write them as a paper, but a similar paper was published at the end of 2017, so the experiment was stopped. ""Indoor positioning using UWB"" I have participated in an indoor positioning study conducted by OO University's network laboratory from April to December 2018. It was a study on indoor positioning using tags and anchors in factories using UWB modules. We implemented an application that fetches Anchor's value stored in the DB, represents it on a map, calculates the value of the tag, and outputs it on the screen in real time. It was produced using Android Studio, and it was changed to a format that fetches the location from the web server due to the loading of the built-in image and the problem of location mapping during the project. After that, in order to analyze the reliability according to the remaining battery capacity of the tag and Anchor, to understand the relationship between the reception speed and location, the experiment was conducted in a place with little interference, and the values accumulated in the DB were analyzed in a graph format using Excel, and the relationship was identified. ""Participation Project"" From September to November 2018, I participated in and completed the 2018 Regional Company Difficulties Solving Competition. We have developed focusing on object search with OOOOOO companies. On Linux, object search was conducted using Google-cloud-vision and OpenCV using C language, but it did not achieve much success. I participated in the industry-academic linkage project organized by OOOOO Bank from July to November 2018. Based on Java, a bank service chatbot based on natural language processing was created using OOO, OOOOOO API and AWS, but it did not win the prize. ""Development of personal & & corporate customized management service"" As I learned computer science, I have realized the importance of existing programs and algorithms when participating in projects or developments. Therefore, at first, I want to improve my overall understanding of the job by grasping the internal implementation and algorithms of programs used by companies such as Lockin'Body Serise. If you are ready to participate in the development after that, I would like to participate in BLE communication between devices or middleware development that can be linked to existing programs so that I can provide personalized health care services by converging in-body, wearable devices, and apps. If the job is recognized through such development, I would like to challenge wearable healthcare products through the task system. Using 5G's large-capacity streaming characteristics, I would like to aim to develop an InBody product that can transmit and receive entire body information in real time and allow customers to check the status with images through applications, AR, and VR. Of course, at the time when 5G is used, it may be absurd and lacking in technology. However, my goal is to develop and provide a wonderful product that can be easily checked with the health of the family at home."
"""Growing Up Through Competition"" Since childhood, I have been an ordinary child who has nothing better than others. For that reason, I had a high sense of competition toward my friends while comparing myself to others. I felt that if someone does something, I can do it, so I had to challenge myself to make it work. The first thing that started was a competition for a 1-year-old Tuul's cousin when I turned 10. When I listened to the sound of a child prodigy while memorizing Chinese characters at an early age, I thought I could do it, so I started learning Chinese characters. While learning for the next four years, I felt a sense of accomplishment through Chinese character tests, which allowed me to maintain excellent grades in Chinese characters in middle and high school. During my school years, I was able to achieve unexpected results through competition with my friends. I was competing with a friend who memorizes world geography, and I started memorizing world maps, and I got a good opportunity to appear in the Golden Bell. Another time, a friend who is similar in writing skills attends an essay writing academy and starts a book collection. Soon after, I won a prize in an essay contest for the first time in my life. I have always been an ordinary person. However, I have a strong desire to improve. After joining the company, I will compare myself with the people around me and make efforts to ensure that their strengths are mine. When I was in charge of the project with the theme of ""Responsibility"" corporate security, I collected the opinions of the team members and divided the roles. In the beginning, all the team members faithfully performed their duties, but as time passed, only silence passed. In the end, the completeness of the mid-term inspection was lower than that of other groups, and I couldn't even answer the professor's questions. After the presentation, we shared our opinions on the inadequate parts. All of the team members said that they lacked the information they needed and were less interested in. So I applied for a corporate tour of a venture company and an IT security company. However, it was rejected because it was an important factor in the company's life or death. However, I was not discouraged by the failure and started to look for other ways. Just in time, I heard the news that the World IT Show is holding a special exhibition on industrial security. I was able to interview working-level officials with my team members, resolve my questions, and directly encounter security products and new technologies. I completed the project by building a sense of intimacy and increasing participation in a short time. After joining the company, I will use this experience to become a talented person who is responsible for my role. We place importance on the principle of flexibility, and we always make plans and proceed with anything. As a result, many of our friends say that we are well-informed. There are times when things go smoothly with thorough preparation and planning, but when unexpected things go awry, there are times when things go awry. Therefore, I will increase my flexibility by listening to people around me. Whenever there is a disruption in my job performance, I will come up with a variety of second-best measures by combining the opinions of all the members. I will become a talented person who can cope with any crisis and perform successfully. Starting with the blood bus when I was a second grader, I have donated blood steadily. Donating blood is meaningful to me because of a small incident during my military service. I am donating after hearing that I, who used to be like brothers, needed a blood donation certificate through my grandfather's surgery. It was a good opportunity to feel that my small actions were of great help to the other person. Due to this, I have been able to pursue everyone's happiness based on my social contribution. After joining the company, I will start the 'Love Blood Donation Campaign' by informing the public of the need for blood donation. I will make it the warmest company in the country beyond the local community. I entered this path after watching a documentary on cyber terrorism when I was a student of ""Cyber Armageddon"". A train accident caused by a 9-year-old boy manipulating a TV remote control in the documentary shocked me a lot. After that, I started studying computer engineering by looking at the history of cyber terrorism and viruses. After completing my basic major, I took Internet security for stable system operation. I built and redistributed network construction using routers, and dynamic static routing tables, and also built firewalls using Linux. In the security network, packets were analyzed in real time, and defense activities such as firewall setting and policy setting were performed. After graduation, I completed an information security curriculum for eight months and learned how to check security equipment and vulnerabilities for stable server operation. I think my strength is the experience of accessing various server OS through vocational education with undergraduate students. I will master work quickly with a high understanding of the server. In addition, based on the contents of the training, I challenged and passed the second-level network manager and the information processing engineer, and I am currently learning security laws aimed at obtaining an information security engineer."
"I thought that the driving force behind the development of civilization was the development of communication means. As a result, many ideas and civilizations were born, and I became interested in them, so I chose to major in the Department of Communication Engineering. I felt only the convenience before learning, but I learned that these technologies, which I felt naturally while learning my major knowledge, have progressed and are still changing rapidly. This job only leaves the cull of the moment I settle for learning, and I realized that a more efficient and economical challenge spirit is the most important with passion for new knowledge and creative thinking. In this way, I heard the news of KT's 5G, and I just happened to have an opportunity to visit before the opening of the PyeongChang Olympics and appreciated the technologies that will be introduced into the game. At this time, I saw the possibility of KT, which is running in the lead above any other company, and I wanted to join. Currently, it does not sound like an empty promise that the era will come when we reach the Fourth Industrial Revolution and do not need a refrigerator claimed by Jack Ma with the emergence of new technologies such as big data, AI, and IOT. Times are changing rapidly, and customer complaints are not 100% satisfactory due to the rising standard of satisfaction felt as technology advances. My biggest goal is to have the ideal network and KT's era in which customers can be 100% satisfied. Let me tell you about my experience in 3D printing that made me what I am today. I first came across 3D printing when I worked at an affiliated factory in a school that practiced engineering equipment and commissioned by external companies. When I first received my education, I first encountered 3D printers while learning the equipment in the factory, and I felt only vague and scary emotions. While feeling these emotions, the factory manager's joke that I should make a model with the 3D printer that I would choose was the biggest turning point in my life. It was a new challenge unrelated to my major, but I wanted to show that I did it because I was a junior in the same organization. The sense of accomplishment and pleasure at the time when I first learned by myself with the most basic design tools through web surfing and created the character Minion cannot be forgotten. When I touched various design tools, searched for related information, and learned the 3D printer based on my experience after numerous trials and errors, I was able to find myself different from the past. Confidence, passion, and willpower are weak. I have come to educate myself on 3D printing in front of others, lead two teams in the 3D printing club as a leader, and I have challenged a drone-related project to merge my major and 3D printer, a new challenge without being complacent. I have experience working on projects aimed at smart farm equipment in Capstone design. I gained confidence in the good results of being auctioned off at the Capstone design presentation, and proceeded with an industry-academia project in connection with the company for six months without stopping here. I aimed to complete the desired voice recognition and application collaboration in a company developed from the existing basic facilities. Initially, I was interested in the machinery sector because companies wanted a systematic structure that could be used in large-scale factories from a simple structure in the shape of a large pot, so I discussed with my team members to challenge. With the help of many data search and acquaintances, I was able to produce frames using profiles and motors, and I made the mistake of miscalling the motor drive in that I directly manufactured motors from Raspberry Pi. I found a way to control it through Arduino after agonizing over the responsibility of all the team members in a state of being unable to re-order it due to time construction. What I learned through trial and error was that we should not lose our will, such as building servers, linking computers with Raspberry Pi and mobile, and applying voice recognition technology for the first time, unexpected servers were locked in security, and Raspberry could not recognize voices. As I was performing my job, I realized that it is people who perform the job, and that a person's mindset is important. The attitude of the other branch is the core competency I thought of. When a company plans a project and technology development, the customer who is the target of the project should be the most important. After all, we need to consider what is needed, inconvenient, and more satisfactory from the customer's point of view for network management and development. The fact that IPv6 addresses were developed due to the lack of IPv4 addresses is that, in the end, customer demand increases, and more than 10 IOTs can be allocated per household due to the gradually complete IOT era as well as devices such as laptops and smartphones. Even if the world's 6 billion people are allocated just two per person, it is too much to speed up the newly developed technologies. At the same time, I thought that there were still many potential customers around the world in line with the era of globalization. As such, I thought that IPv6 was developed because the IPv4 address system had limitations in considering the future technologies and the number of potential customers. Technology does not always achieve right and good results, so I thought that the top priority for technology development in a company is always to consider whether it is possible to gain convenience, smoothness, and satisfaction from the customer's point of view when encountering this technology. When I learned new knowledge or looked for articles on new technologies, I thought about what they had developed these technologies and whether there were any other ways."
"Like the experience of learning JQuery that I didn't know well while creating the first site, Gametwo, and voluntarily working on renovations for higher completion, I have pursued 'dedication' that goes beyond my goals. As the final project of the Java & Big Data Developer Training Course, our team used the spring MVC2 model to plan Gametwo based on the existing Gameone site. We started developing a baseball site with the theme of ""Baseball Site"" to implement functions that users can use more actively, including team creation and team site management, and to deal with vast amounts of data such as game records and rankings. As it was meant to be the first site, I wanted to create a site that was comparable to Gameone. To do this, I first learned by actively colliding with JQuery to be familiar with it. The actual site utilized asynchronous communication through Ajax to minimize reloading for the user's convenience. However, these contents were not covered in the class, so additional learning was required, so the team members wanted to implement the targeted functions within the scope of learning. I organized and implemented all 50 functions to learn the basics of JQuery, and I directly asked questions to Naver intellectuals for parts that were difficult to apply. The chat function and Ajax, which were difficult to solve, were implemented with remote help by person in charge of web development. And by sharing and teaching everyone the learned knowledge, I was able to create sophisticated functions, including toggles and date pickers. Next, after the project presentation, I spent about a month working on the repair work. The training was completed, but as a developer of the site, I was unable to implement it, or to observe incomplete sites such as functions that cause errors, and rugged web design. So I contacted the team leader first and suggested the repair work, and I fixed all errors that occurred by executing the functions one by one together. In particular, when registering for the lineup of the game, I contacted the front-end incumbent to create a function to visualize players in the stadium, and I was able to find and complete the clues. I will maintain the attitude of NCSOFT to passionately and devotedly perform it while performing something while performing the task. We will always provide high-quality services to customers by setting high standards on our own. In order to acquire the expertise of the data engineer's job, we have developed 'Hadoop Eco System' technology and 'constant communication' capabilities. After completing the Java & Big Data Developer Training Course, I learned MapReduce, Pig, Hive, and Hbase using HDFS by reading through the book specializing in the Hadoop perfect guide with interest in Hadoop. In particular, we directly coded MapReduce to analyze vast amounts of data such as Seoul bus boarding/exit data and U.S. flight data to specify the learned knowledge. In addition, I believe that the most necessary competency in the job of data engineer is 'constant communication'. Constant communication with colleagues is essential in finding better ways to solve the problems faced and developing by making up for each other's shortcomings in the process. I have experience in successfully completing the 'Seoul Metropolitan Daily Rainfall Forecast Web and App' Hadoop project by introducing AWS Cloud through active communication with team members. In order to secure the capacity required to build a Hadoop cluster, we discussed problems and limitations with team members for each trial and error. After actively discussing the limitations of the existing method of using VMware with my team member, I was able to think of AWS that rents capacity virtually. I collected and organized academic materials, made them into a manual together, and learned EC2. Whenever an error occurred in private IP settings and putty accesses, I always looked for 'why' and after looking for a solution, AWS found that setting up a security group was the most important consideration. Finally, by allocating enough capacity, we were able to build a Hadoop cluster consisting of NameNode, Secondary NameNode, and three DataNodes. Since then, we have secured high availability through duplexing of NameNode using Zookeeper. We analyzed the precipitation data of Seoul City from 1908 to 2018 as MapReduce and successfully completed the project by storing the results in the MySQL DB and visualizing them with the web and apps. It was a small project, but it was able to achieve two fruits. First, we were able to not only solve the problem by approaching the problem in a different way than before, but also learn the IaaS cloud. I learned that new insights can be created when a large number of thoughts gather, not alone. In addition, I felt the importance of communication for problem solving by introducing a new environment called EC2. I was able to quickly find and correct errors that occurred by actively asking and giving advice on what we know each other. Like this experience, I will seek continuous improvement of the existing work process through active communication between colleagues and departments. In addition, I will not hesitate to acquire the necessary new skills to accurately reflect the customer's requirements. We will provide the necessary data stably with the ability to build a Hadoop distributed cluster for loading and operating large-capacity log data. NCSOFT cited AI as one of the new innovative technologies of the future and heard that it will create a new game play based on AI. Two goals were established to contribute to big data analysis by participating in the development direction of NCSOFT. First, I will learn the Hadoop Eco System technology necessary for big data infrastructure operation and development. So, I will understand the entire process from data collection to storage, processing, and analysis and quickly fall into practice. Based on the learned knowledge, we will quickly identify the data platform trends in the field and supplement the lack of data collection technology by acquiring Kafka, Flume open source. Since I have only dealt with processed csv structured data so far, I will even deal with unstructured data such as game log data and secure expertise.Second, I will develop my data analysis capabilities. If you lack an understanding of data terms and statistical techniques, you cannot provide the Dataset that analysts want. I will acquire open sources for data analysis such as Spark SQL, Streaming, and MLlib, and invest in self-development with the aim of ADP certification. Recently, I learned the API by learning Spark's development languages, scala and python, through a specialized book, and I am working on the MLlib project using them. In addition, I learned statistical techniques and R by acquiring ADsP. Based on this learning, I will quickly apply the necessary open-source skills."
"""IBK Industrial Bank Becoming a General Financial IT Company"" I visited the financial IT counseling booth at the in-school Job Festival held on campus last year. I came across a senior graduate who is currently working at a financial IT company at the booth. In the process of receiving counseling, I was told about the vision of financial IT. Since then, I have confirmed IBK Industrial Bank's business expansion in development and technical support for financial and fintech solutions such as ""opening a quick account"" and ""ARS foreign currency remittance,"" and I wanted to work for this company that is constantly growing in the fintech market. I have no experience in developing financial IT, but as a student majoring in computer engineering, I have faithfully gained project experience by utilizing JAVA, a computer language I learned, and I have made efforts to improve my communication skills through various external activities in addition to my major activities. Based on these experiences, I want to lead a comprehensive bank that manages not only SW development but also overall financial IT services. Currently, IBK Industrial Bank of Korea is expanding its investment business to prepare for the era of IT finance, including its equity investment in Webcash, a software company, and seven fintech companies, so I think it is necessary to strengthen manpower accordingly. If I join IBK Industrial Bank of Korea, I will sincerely learn the technology of non-face-to-face channel service, which is a future source of income, and try to become a member of the best recognized company in the overseas financial IT market in the long term. ""Activity - Attitude to fill the deficiencies"" As a digital employee, my competitiveness is activeness. It is because I have actively tried to make up for my shortcomings. The reason for this effort is the failure of the 'This is the OOO Competition'. When I was a freshman in college, I participated in the 'This is the Java Competition' using the 'This is the Java' textbook and proceeded with a project to implement the 'Java FX-based ATM'. By using the account creation login, the main page and the deposit, remittance, and balance check buttons, I aimed to execute the event on that button. However, because DB and JSP were not studied, they were not able to model data and code DAO and DTO classes on the server program based on the member data design, and they neglected to learn in this area. In the end, it remained an incomplete project that only implemented the ATM button function excluding the login function. With this opportunity, we made two efforts to improve the value of actively approaching technologies that we have not learned. First, I completed lectures not only from university classes but also from other IT institutions. After completion of the course, I implemented the 'JSP-based university lecture evaluation system' using the recently frequently used bootstrap 4 framework. In the process of creating a web-based program, I experienced the process of web development from web design, web server development, function test and distribution. In addition, while designing the 'Hospital DB', it was schematized into an ER diagram, and 20 work process scenarios that may occur in the hospital were set and printed out, thereby enhancing the logical analysis skills required for digital employees. Second, through working in the Air Force computer room and field training in the summer, I got an opportunity to learn in the field rather than theoretical learning. Such active learning habits will be able to demonstrate their capabilities to contribute to the advancement of smart financial services such as big data and fintech by IBK in the future. ""We will show you sustainable creativity."" I think the attitude of planning and developing unprecedented tasks is an opportunity for digital employees to improve new ideas. With the recent high issue of fine dust, we decided to create an app that measures the value of fine dust using Arduino, fine dust sensors, GPS sensors, and Bluetooth modules under the theme of the graduation project, displays the measured area on Google Maps, and represents the value of fine dust in a graph chart. However, the professor evaluated that there was no difference from existing fine dust measuring stations. Later, through a meeting with the team members, we tried a differentiated method of attaching a fine dust sensor by manufacturing an Arduino drone. The disadvantage of not being able to provide accurate information to people due to the lack of monitoring stations nationwide was to obtain the value of dust in the area that we wanted to check through drone control. Although we received a deduction in terms of commercialization, we were evaluated by the professor for breaking away from the measurement method in a fixed place and approaching the problem with a new perspective. Through this, I had the experience of agonizing over finding ideas that did not adhere to the existing methods in that I presented new ideas and implemented the final results. However, I was very disappointed that the government failed to consider users, such as designating drone-restricted zones and restricting altitude, after the project was completed. By supplementing these problems, I learned a lesson to make users think about their customers all the time. ""Achievements as one"" I have experience in effective promotional activities by encouraging team members in offline activities of OOO Korea. I loved traveling and wanted to apply to OOO Korea supporters and interact with college students with similar interests. Building friendship among team members was the most important in our activities, so we scheduled dinner every two weeks and talked about each other. Conversations helped to boost team morale, and we voluntarily planned offline promotional activities that were not mandatory activities. However, during offline activities in Yeouido Mulbit Plaza, not all team members could easily reach the citizens. I approached the citizens humorously first so that the team members could work without feeling awkward and confident, and when the team members first spoke to the citizens, I was supported by them and helped them to work actively. After the activities were over, the team members expressed their gratitude to me for being considerate and instilling a small courage. Above all, it was good that all the team members were able to enjoy their activities without feeling awkward because of me. I found that solving problems through such small consideration to my colleagues helps improve the team atmosphere."
"""Game and QA"" It was always a way to stop playing games. At first, it was just a way to have fun and relieve stress. When an error occurred while enjoying the game, I continued to create similar situations, looked for the reason for the error, and when I found the reason, I felt a sense of accomplishment. At the same time, I learned about Close Beta, and I always applied for games I was interested in, trying to detect errors before the game was released. Later, I went to the software department, and while taking a course called software engineering, I learned about the job of QA and became interested in it as I learned about various test tools and techniques. After that, I was able to try out the methods I learned while working on my graduation project. I thought I had done a perfect job in development, but I was surprised that there were errors that were found. I was able to find parts where the inequality was set wrong, and I was able to correct the wrong code by looking at an actuator that was operating differently than expected. As I discovered and solved the problem, I was able to feel a sense of accomplishment and interest. Afterwards, I learned about the CSTS certificate while I was looking into it because I wanted to study it more deeply, and I was able to apply for a related lecture. After taking the lecture, I failed at first on the test, and after that, I studied harder so I was able to pass the second test. I learned about game QA while thinking about the job of QA, which I was interested in, and what would allow me to experience games that I was interested in. There is a saying that goes, ""Genius cannot beat those who try, and those who try cannot beat those who enjoy."" Until now, if you have been an ""effort"" to become a game QA, from now on, I want to become a ""effort"" by becoming a game QA myself. I have never tested the game using test tools and techniques myself, but I think that I can quickly become an ""effort"" with overall knowledge about the test and interest and knowledge about the game. After planning and developing the ""The! The! The!"" game, you can release a single completed game. However, I don't think there is a perfect game without errors. Although there were no problems at the time of development, many unexpected errors can be found, such as compatibility with the device or OS immediately after release or user input mistakes. These errors will reduce the completeness of the game, which can act as a factor to reduce user interest. In addition, correcting it after release is expensive and time consuming, and can cause inconvenience to users. I think the QA job is what is needed to release more complete and satisfying games with less cost and time. During the vacation ""Necessity of QA through Experience"", I had an internship at an SI company for a month. During the month-long period, I was able to test the Yongin City water supply network system and write a user guide. With two developers and another intern, we tested the function based on the requirement definition. After each test was conducted, the errors found were sorted out, and the problems were improved through meetings with the developer. Other errors occurred depending on the OS, device, and web browser used, and when looking at the errors found by others, there were errors that I had not thought of. I could feel the need for various test cases as I saw errors in which data was not saved when decimal points were entered in the part of entering numbers, errors that worked well in Explorer, but did not work in Chrome. No one had specialized knowledge of testing, and I didn't use test tools, so I needed more time, and I felt that there were many shortcomings. Through this, I felt that I needed a professional QA."
"""Campfire on Fire"" I'd like to compare Nepass Co., Ltd. to a song called ""Campfire"" by Peppertons. It's because ""Campfire"" sits in front of the campfire in the midst of an unstable future, reminiscing about good things, and singing about the conviction that I will continue to shine. In the semiconductor and IOT industries, which may be unstable because they always develop new technologies and change frequently across the industry, Nepass Co., Ltd. created a pleasant company atmosphere based on ""Song Management"" and ""Thank You Management"" and developed the world's first ""Neuromorphic Chip."" Since chips have the characteristics of neurons as their name suggests, Nepass Co., Ltd. was convinced that they would grow by implementing artificial intelligence in their machines, so I came up with the song ""Campfire"" in connection with Nepass. Especially, the lyrics that I liked the most are ""Sing to See. We shall shine here like the burning light."" If I become a member of the production technology IT department of Nepass Co., Ltd., I will contribute to such technological advancement. ""Production: New Start and End of Customer Satisfaction."" The production of the product is a new start, and the way to satisfy customers is after all, the product. In the process of production, which was an important start, I designed the automation system to be more efficient and reliable, and supported the customer's entire process for fast and correct production. ""Industrial engineering knowledge, creativity, and communication skills."" I have learned statistics necessary for lean production methods through my major in industrial engineering and have studied logistics, reliability, and ergonomics necessary for FDC, RMS, and EAP design. By conducting projects using C and C++ languages, I can approach and solve problems anew based on the subjects of Practical TRIZ or Design Methodology. I worked on about 30 projects, both large and small, with students from various majors, understanding the differences and developing communication skills. Based on this, I am confident that I will be able to become a member of the production technology IT department of Nepass Co., Ltd. and help realize the SMART factory. I was the team leader for a year while preparing for the graduation work for the subject of ""Leading Graduation Work and Winning Competition"" and ""Industrial Engineering Capstone Design."" The theme was ""Selection of Hub Location for Optimization of Blood Logistics."" To this end, I collected the necessary data and created a cluster of hospitals using the R program, and produced them with PPT. I made and calculated a formula for the assumption of data utilization situation. In addition, I found the theory and shared it with my team members. I shared the work by considering the strengths and circumstances of the team members. When there was a friction between the classmates while the work was in progress, I heard enough about the two and conveyed to each other that there was a misunderstanding in the desire to perform the task well even in a busy situation. I organized the data with the two classmates and submitted the graduation work by supplementing the PPT. Despite the trial and error, our team was selected as an outstanding team on campus and received a silver award by submitting to the SCM competition for Korean university students. ""I am grateful for everything from one thing to ten."" 1. Having the health to see, hear, and move. 2. Meeting my family and friends in a variety of environments and choices. 4. What my parents waited for me to challenge myself enough. 5. Having the opportunity to do design engineering as well as industrial engineering at university. 7. Being born in an era of computer-aided possibilities. 8. Having touching culture and arts, such as beautiful music, dance, painting, exercise, food, and so on. 9. Having people who like me and like me. 10. It was hard to deduce only 10 things to be thankful for today's nice weather. I will always be grateful for. I have been a person who is 'generous to others and strict to me'. They understood other people's problems well, but I didn't really take care of myself, so my trivial problems made me feel intimidated. At the time, I chose to major in multiple majors and felt burdened with my studies and lacked confidence compared to design majors, so I controlled my mind by reading self-improvement books and humanities books to overcome them. Meanwhile, I learned the method called ""artist date."" ""Artist date"" is about meeting yourself once a week alone, doing what I want to do, and I spent time taking a walk around the neighborhood or stopping by art galleries and flower markets to fully relax and enjoy. Through ""Artist Date,"" I took care of myself, saw and felt various things around me, and my stubborn heart softened. As a result, I became more flexible in my thoughts and participated more actively in my studies, and above all, as I had a heart that loved me, I learned how to be considerate of others with more sincerity than before."
"I have the experience of launching a smart curating service using Bluetooth and beacon in the OOO museum. I was in charge of researching indoor location-based algorithms and initially implemented them using BLE signals, but I found a problem that the accuracy was low due to signal distortion and refraction caused by high ceilings and steel walls. It was a big crisis prior to commercialization, but I constantly visited the site every day for better performance, observing facilities and people, and looking for ways to overcome the crisis. After hard work, I overcame the crisis by implementing an algorithm that fused relatively accurate magnetic field sensors to significantly reduce the error rate. Through this, we published a number of papers and applied for two patents. I found that commercialization services were very difficult, unlike simple school projects. The test process also took a considerable amount of time, as errors can even lead to loss of customers. Through this, it was possible to indirectly experience the process of creating a new service at a company such as SK C&C, and it was also a representative achievement experience that was most meaningful because I could sympathize with the many people's efforts behind it. As an industry-academia joint project, I formed a team with one company and participated with planning, design, and majors, and it was a time to communicate with the multidisciplinary team and experience the design process. I would like to create new customer value that combines technology and business with SK based on the convergence and collaboration capabilities that have designed the entire process from problem recognition to solution. I saw many students standing in line in the elevator on the way to class, and I looked for a way to increase the utilization rate of stairs. I thought that if I played the piano sound when climbing the stairs, it would increase the use of stairs and reduce elevator congestion. When I investigated previous studies and cases, there was a case where it was manufactured using a pressure sensor. It was judged that the use of a pressure sensor could cause frequent breakdowns when many people used it, and it was differentiated by a non-contact method and a low unit price infrared sensor in order to use it without minor failure for a long time. A project to solve the problem was carried out in academic consumption. A scale suitable for each step was outputted through a speaker by detecting a person's foot with a sensor. Troubleshooting by electricity occurred during the output process, but the cause was found through a systematic approach and analysis, and it was solved through ground reorganization. It was memorable for a long time that it was installed on campus for three days and received the attention of students and professors, and that it resolved the inconvenience that began with the sense of improvement. Above all, it remains an unforgettable memory that we solved the inconvenience in life through the project. In addition, in the Subway Passenger Distribution System by using CO2 Concentrations Data study, I remember getting on the subway line 1 directly to measure carbon dioxide and count the passengers in the cabin one by one. After analyzing the correlation between the amount of carbon dioxide and people, I was able to achieve the results of exhibiting it at the IoT Conference Demo Session held in Germany. When I participated in the medical hackathon, I had meetings with medical experts, developers, and designer participants and thought deeply about the products and services that people need. With the hope that surgical patients will recover quickly with the help of this walking aid, just as cats carefully walk in small spaces, the team participated in the event as a team called ""CatWalk Beautiful Accompaniment."" CatWalk provides exercise guides and allows customized walking exercises. In fact, most surgical patients have to walk, but they have a lot of difficulties in how much they should exercise and whether they are doing it correctly. CatWalk has implemented it by intuitively showing customized exercise guidelines and real-time exercise progress graphs based on exercise distance, exercise time, and gait dependence on existing walkers by reflecting opinions on walking issues at hospitals. Unlike simple coding competitions or contests where developers gather to present ideas, it was a more special experience in that they were able to consider and implement services needed by patients with on-the-job medical staff and designers. Thanks to what they learned and experienced while conducting convergence research, they were able to receive popularity and special awards. The New ICT field, the Application C language, is the language that I have learned the longest because it is used in various fields from application programming to network, system, and graphic programming. At the college level, I am good enough to implement a demo program, and I can say that it is the most confident language. Recently, I became interested in Watson through a webinar, and I have the experience of presenting a paper to the Korean Design Association using a Watson API demo. The thesis topic is ""Professional of Interactive Language Learning System (ILS) using ICT Technology,"" and the experiment was conducted using Watson's Visual Recognition, Text to Speech demonstrations with high recognition rates. Recently, I tried to install a kernel on the Linux operating system using Raspberry Pi and controlled GPIO. Finally, I was able to link the temperature and humidity sensor with MySQL and store it in the database and even check it on the web. In addition, I have produced artificial intelligence Amazon Alexa with raspberry pie, microphone, and speaker using open source, and while studying deep learning, I have experience implementing cost function and gradient design function in Python language. Even after joining SK C&C, I want to study the deep learning field in AIBRIL business. Last semester, I studied classification algorithms such as SVM and statistics through data mining class.Since June, beacon data has been collected and analyzed in the project ""Development of Robustness and Precision Improvement Technology in Indoor Location Estimation Technology"". In the ""Development and Validation of Interactive Language Learning Device"" project, we are testing a demonstration of an object recognition application that has learned 1,000 objects using TensorFlow, and we are constantly looking for ways to increase the recognition rate. I have experience in developing art tools to reduce the experience waiting time with Children's Hospital of Seoul OO Hospital. Many hospitals have been agonizing over the problem since many complaints have been raised among patients about the long waiting time and the short treatment time for many years, but they have not been able to come up with a suitable alternative. In the lab, a team of Humaneers (Human + Engineering) were gathered and made a cooperative proposal through e-mail to the hospital. The hospital also received an answer that it recognized the problem and let's solve it together, and we recognized the limitations that we could not physically solve and cooperated by continuously communicating and solving them from a psychological perspective. The biggest reason why we were able to solve the problem was the rendezvous between various majors. Due to the nature of the laboratory, I think it was possible to achieve outstanding results because humanities, design, and engineering majors went through the entire process from problem recognition to solutions through collaboration. Even though I was an engineer, I participated in discovering problems by observing them at the hospital for three days with my team members who majored in humanities, planning, and design. By going to the field, I was able to discover unexpected parts in the desk research process, and through interviews, I was able to hear the thoughts of doctors, nurses, and patients. When developing the demo, it reflected all of what I felt in the field. The level of manipulation was determined according to the patient's age group, and the range of automation was determined according to the workload of nurses. Finally, the pictures drawn by children were inputted through a scanner and implemented so that it could become a fairy tale story on the TV in the waiting room."
"While preparing for the wearable software contest, I became interested in the game industry. We developed a smart band and an attention game, and linked a headband that can measure brain waves with a mobile game to induce children with attention deficit disorder to focus. For the first time in charge of developing Android games, there were many difficulties in the process of implementing Bluetooth communication, but I looked for books in the library and referenced open sources on the Internet to implement them. As a result, it ended up winning an encouragement award, but it is still a good memory because it is the first project in college that was not good. Through the first project, I was able to break the perception that games are bad, and I realized that if I plan and develop them well, they can be valuable tools to people. Currently, we are working on a project to develop art tools to reduce the amount of time spent waiting, and we are improving the problem of long waiting times compared to medical hours, which have been raised as many complaints among patients for years. Although I am an engineer, I was able to find unexpected parts in the desk research process through three days of observation at the hospital with my team members who majored in humanities, planning, and design, and I was able to hear the thoughts of doctors, nurses, and patients through interviews. When I developed the demo, I reflected everything I felt in the field. Finally, the children's drawings were inputted through a scanner and the contents that became a fairy tale on the TV in the waiting room were implemented. If the previous game industry was far from everyday life, I think it will melt into everyday life and blur the boundaries with various cultural industries in the future. I want to provide value of life through games and bring joy to people. Through the on-campus Job Fair event, I was able to feel Netmarble's remarkable growth and responsibility, and I supported it because I was convinced that Netmarble, which is leading the global game culture by bringing joy to people around the world through games, will be able to grow together by becoming a fan. The areas that are drawing attention in the 4th Industrial Revolution include artificial intelligence, IoT, cloud computing, big data, mobile, and blockchain, but I think data will be the most important core. Since the games published and developed by Netmarble have hundreds of thousands of simultaneous users, they have more user data than any other company that cannot be converted into money. The user data stored in the data center takes up only storage and is nothing more than useless trash if not analyzed and processed. In the future, Netmarble is responsible for analyzing user data acquired through games to create value, and if this is achieved, I think it can not only expand its business area but also leap into a global game culture company. For example, if we collect standardized data such as the user's age, gender, chat record, item purchase pattern, access time, and location, predict qualitative data such as personality and interpersonal relationships through statistics and analysis, and target marketing that is actively used for story reflection and marketing in the game according to the user's current status, it will be a good game and lead to excellent results. In order to value the data Netmarble has, I think the first thing to do is not to look at the problem only in one aspect, but to hire talented people with convergence capabilities to think from various aspects and to communicate with experts in various disciplines. For two years, I formed a multidisciplinary team with humanities, design, planning, and majors in graduate school to collaborate on all processes from problem recognition to solutions, and conducted human-centered studies on HCI, UX, and IoT were very similar to the Knowhow-Sharing system and T-type talent training system, which become members of Netmarble. I think the past experiences have laid the foundation for us to think about and prepare for the future with Netmarble. I want to become a talented person who can lead the era of the 4th industrial revolution with Netmarble, a company that can lead the era of the 4th industrial revolution. First, in terms of the business area, I want to create a game that can simply give knowledge or wisdom in life out of pleasure. If you look at the recently released films, you can see many films based on historical facts or true stories. I was able to become more immersed and attract the public's attention by using visually dynamic images through cultural life, unlike in the past, when I studied historical events simply through writing. I thought that it would be a more immersive and enjoyable game for all ages if historical events or everyday life were made into a story in the game in the same way and developed so that I could experience it indirectly. Second, in terms of the personnel system, since a person is the purpose of being, I would like to make it possible to carry pride in the company by guaranteeing lifetime employment without evaluating it through relative comparison with others. Many companies are making it an endlessly competitive society through performance-oriented incentives. This is becoming a vicious cycle in which many office workers are under increased stress and their efficiency decreases. Contrary to other companies, with the adoption of a salary system, I would like to reduce performance incentives to a minimum, and operate it so that employees can exercise their autonomous growth and capabilities by arousing enthusiasm through the company's trust and responsibility. Third, in terms of social contribution, I would like to establish a public interest foundation. I want to foster a good company that fulfills its social responsibility and does its duty, unlike past companies that only pursue profits through activities such as delivering a small amount of consolation money to those who suffered from accidents, disasters, or disasters, and awarding personality awards to those who sacrificed themselves for the country and society. First, I want to work with a colleague who is proud and attached to the company and enjoys working. It is commonly known that game companies have high intensity of work and are continuous overtime every day. As much as people feel differently when they do things they like and when they do things they dislike, if they do not enjoy the work, they may be stressed out every day and even hurt the people around them.The reason why the engineer's dream, which I decided in middle school, was able to maintain without changing is because it was fun to conduct convergence research using IT technology. I was able to go to graduate school because of my aptitude, and unlike other laboratories, my affiliated laboratory has the advantage of creating synergies by gathering humanities, design, planning, and engineering majors to go through all the processes from problem recognition to solutions. Because I have a sense of pride and attachment to the laboratory, I feel proud without having difficulty studying with my colleagues until late at night. Second, I want to work with a colleague who respects the capabilities of others, and a colleague who can discover strengths and make up for weaknesses. In an organization, every member is precious. Sometimes I think that even though some are good and others seem invisible, all of the team members must grow together. I think the biggest reason why we were able to successfully complete studies to create value that did not exist before, such as subway passenger distribution system, display smart curating service, and improving waiting time for children's hospitals, starting with intervention device research with store owners due to the occupancy time of cafe customers in graduate school, was because of the mindset of all colleagues who majored in humanities, design, planning, and engineering to properly utilize each other's strengths and compensate for their weaknesses. Based on my past experiences, I think it will be a pleasant working life if I am with the above two types of colleagues, and I am confident that all talented people who join Netmarble will be good colleagues. I became interested in AI through webinar, and I have experience presenting a paper to the Korean Design Association using IBM Watson API demo. The topic of the thesis is ""Professional of Interactive Language Learning System (ILS) using ICT Technology,"" and I was able to experience Watson's Visual Recognition and Text to Speech demo, which has a high recognition rate. He is currently studying deep learning and is also studying various classification algorithms through supporting statistics and data mining classes. Using open sources, he created an artificial intelligence Amazon Alexa with raspberry pie, microphone, and speaker, and implemented a stock price prediction program. In the ""Development and validation of interactive language learning device"" project, we are testing a demonstration of an object recognition application that has learned 1,000 objects, and we are reading related papers to find ways to increase the recognition rate. From June, he participated in the research project ""Study for environmental performance of robustness and precision in fingerprinting and PDR technologies for indirect location estimation"" and is in charge of data collection and analysis. As it is currently in the early stages of research, we are looking for related studies, and finally, the final goal is to estimate the indoor location more accurately and robustly through the deep learning process of AP wireless signals. Although I am still at the beginner level since I just started studying AI, I confidently promise that I will grow up with my outstanding colleagues at Netmarble in the future and become a talented person who will lead the company in the distant future. Research can be defined differently depending on the field of study or the times, but I think it is a process of deeply learning about the object in common. Research can clarify the expression or explanation of the object, and it can also uncover the correlation. Correlation can predict the future, or control and manipulate it based on the predicted results. Recently, many companies are accelerating AI research. When a logic that imitates the human brain is designed and implemented so that computers can judge on their own, it is already more accurate and faster than humans in the field of image processing and voice recognition. In the future, AI research is expected to be used in various fields. In order to plan and conduct AI research, I think it is important not only to have statistics and mathematical abilities, but also to understand the knowledge of HCI or UX, and the trend of the times. It is not common for engineering majors to study UX, but I think it will be difficult to create good services without going through UX design courses that understand people's behavior and emotions rather than technology in the future. I was able to learn the engineering competencies I learned while majoring in in information and communication electronics engineering and the approaches to defining problems and solving problems through convergence research at the graduate school. A product or service includes core technology, but in the end, the ultimate target of technology is people, so it will be a more meaningful and necessary study if the context is understood and developed from the research stage. In order to become an engineer who understands the trend of the times and actively responds to changes, I set a quantitative goal of reading more than one trend book per month. As new knowledge and related technologies are pouring out every day in the IT field, I want to study the discovery, implementation, test, and application of new technologies repeatedly to keep up with the trend."
"In order to become an engineer who understands the trend of the times and actively responds to changes, I read more than one trend book per month, and set a quantitative goal of publishing more than two papers or patents a year. As new knowledge and related technologies are pouring out every day in the IoT and artificial intelligence fields, I want to become a talented person who challenges myself by repeating the process of discovering, implementing, testing, and applying new technologies to keep up with the trend. I feel energized and happy when I accomplish something I don't think I can do. When I was traveling in the Philippines, I challenged myself to scuba dive and got an Open Water license even though I couldn't swim due to my water phobia. This may seem easy, but because of the memory of drowning in a swimming pool in elementary school, I never dreamed of going into the sea 18m in my life. I recognized that the reality that I couldn't always have fun when I went to a swimming pool was a problem that I had to overcome someday, and I was able to challenge the saying that the underwater in the Philippines is one of the world's top 10 diving points. At first, I started with a light thought that it would be more comfortable to go into the water with an oxygen respirator, but contrary to my expectations, I experienced death due to pain caused by waves and air pressure. Previously, I was busy avoiding anything difficult, but looking back, most of them were trivial things that I could do. Experiencing underwater helped me a lot improve my confidence, have a positive mindset to solve problems, and develop my ability to see the forest rather than the tree. If I join Woori Bank, I want to become a person who creates existing values by converging technology and customers' businesses based on future technologies. Core technologies are included in products and services, but in the end, people are the ultimate targets of technology, so it will be more meaningful and necessary research if the context is understood and developed from the research stage. As Woori Bank is reinforcing its digital jobs, it is studying deep learning, one of the fields of artificial intelligence, and is also studying various classification algorithms through statistics and data mining classes to support it. Using open sources, we have produced AI Amazon Alexa with raspberry pie, microphone, and speaker, and have also implemented stock price prediction programs. Based on the research capabilities we have carried out, we want to focus on the development of financial products based on artificial intelligence and research on digital marketing. Furthermore, I would like to create customer value that did not exist before by converging core technologies with customer business. In the ""Development and validation of interactive language learning device"" project, we are testing object recognition application demos that have learned 1000 objects and are looking for ways to increase the recognition rate. In the 4th Industrial Revolution, companies with data will change our world. Woori Bank secured a lot of customer data and applied with confidence that it will become the best financial company if it makes good use of it. Together with Woori Bank, we want to make the future imaginary financial aspects a reality. I have experience in launching IoT-based smart curating service using Bluetooth and beacon in the OOO Museum. I was in charge of researching indoor location-based algorithms and initially implemented them by using BLE signals, but I found a problem that the accuracy was low due to the distortion and refraction of the signal caused by the high ceiling and steel wall. It was a big crisis prior to commercialization, but I constantly visited the site every day to observe facilities and people for better performance and looked for ways. After much consideration, we overcame the crisis by significantly lowering the error rate by implementing an algorithm that fused relatively accurate magnetic field sensors. Through this, a number of papers were published and two patents were filed. I found that commercialization services were very difficult, unlike simple school projects. The test process also took a considerable amount of time, as errors could lead to the loss of customers. Through this, I was able to experience a little indirectly the process of the creation of a new service in a company, and I could also sympathize with the many efforts behind it, which was the most meaningful achievement. I have experience in developing art tools to reduce the waiting time at Seoul OO Hospital and Children's Hospital. Many hospitals have been agonizing over the problem since many years ago due to the long waiting time and the short treatment time, but they have not been able to come up with a suitable alternative. In the laboratory, a team of Humaneers (Human + Engineers) were gathered to propose cooperation to the hospital through e-mail. The hospital also received an answer to recognize the problem and solve it together, and we recognized the limitations that cannot be physically solved, and we worked together through constant communication and cooperation to solve them from a psychological perspective. The biggest reason I was able to solve the problem was creative thinking and a shift in thinking. I think I was able to achieve excellent results because humanities, design, and engineering majors collaborated through rendezvous between various majors to go through the whole process from problem recognition to solutions. I also participated in the work of discovering problems by observing them at the hospital for three days with my team members who majored in humanities, planning, and design. By breaking the old idea that engineers only work at desks and going out to the field, I had the experience of discovering unexpected parts in the desk research process. Since my dream of creating new things has always been in my heart, I am going to graduate school and focusing on research activities related to HCI and IoT. Woori Bank also wants to advance toward my dream by researching new technologies and developing business models that integrate finance. I feel proud and attached to the fact that I am currently conducting human-centered research based on new technologies in H-Lab. The human-friendly HCI field pursued by H-Lab is considered an essential discipline in the Fourth Industrial Revolution, but in the case of Korea, it is recognized as a very unfamiliar field as an early stage.I am confident that I can contribute to the future even if I become a member of Woori Bank by learning for two years the research capabilities that can create the best synergy effect by designing every process from problem recognition to solutions by gathering humanities, design, and engineering majors. It will be a better strategy if you understand and study human contexts from the early stages. We are used to constantly creating new things through multidisciplinary convergence research, and we will be the first mover of ICT, emotional, and design convergence technologies that bring out social and human communication skills according to the demand of the times that changes based on user experience rather than technology-oriented."
"""Central Inventory Management System with Creativity"" My extraordinary talent is 'creativity'. I have the ability to make people's lives more convenient by adding creativity to my enhanced technology based on my experience in various projects. For example, I proposed a central inventory management system by showing creativity in the 'Improving the Inventory Management System of Clothing Stores' project. When using online clothing stores, there was an inconvenience of having to contact the store directly to check the inventory. Since it was difficult to link the order information DB and the inventory DB in real time, I decided that it was not a difficult task for companies. In order to solve this problem, I suggested benchmarking the OOO service, which is a method of delivering order information by store, after receiving orders collectively from the central government. To differentiate it from the OOO service, we added a function to recommend stores close to the customer's location through GPS location-based service. It was well received by the professor in charge of the system that satisfied the efficiency of corporate operation and the needs of customers, and it won first place in creativity and convenience among a total of eight teams. I was able to come up with creative ideas by expanding my thoughts, not limited to clothing stores. Through IT services based on creativity, we are ready to support Korean Yakult, which strives to develop 'New One Product' rather than 'Me Too Product'. In this way, I will deliver a true impression to everyone who is engaged in Korean Yakult. ""Korea Yakult's co-worker"" The most difficult experience was when I worked on a project to improve the school's course registration system. To make matters worse, a team member who was in charge of PM due to early employment was excluded in the middle and had to bear a large amount of work, and I suffered from a team member who was lagging behind. As I was a double major student, I was a team member who lacked basic knowledge of UML. I delivered the materials I referred to when I took the programming course, gave questions and answers to them at times through messenger, and helped my team members understand. At first, it was somewhat difficult to understand unfamiliar concepts such as objects and attributes, but as a result of steadily helping me learn, I made it without difficult for myself to write DFD. My task alone was very overwhelming. However, when I first learned UML, I tried to understand the position of my team members by recalling the old self, which was difficult, and I tried hard to recall that it was not a goal alone, but a common goal. As a result, everyone was able to actively participate without a single dropout, resulting in high-quality results. I think I was able to achieve results because I shared and led the difficulties of my team members. Through this, I learned the power of collaboration, and I have grown into a person who practices collaboration in person. I will be a co-worker of Korean Yakult who can trust me to encourage my team members and improve work performance without giving up no matter what difficulties I face. ""A company that values basics, only kicks 100 times,"" and how much I value 'basics' is the most important criterion for choosing a company. This is because employees who have been based on basics can grow into talented people who don't have any qualms about new challenges. With the vitalization of hypermarkets, door-to-door sales were recognized as an outdated distribution channel, but Korean Yakult still makes it a principle to deliver products directly to consumers. As such, Korean Yakult values basics, so it can maintain its operating profit ratio of 9% which is rare in the food industry, and I think that 'cold brew' and 'frozen yakult' which hit the jackpot were also derived from these basics. I learned the importance of the basics by preparing taegwonmu through overseas volunteer cultural performances. I was always bad at dancing during the kindergarten talent show, so I was naturally placed on the edge of a large scale. However, I practiced with the goal of completing such a perfect movement that I could stand on the main stage. At first, I only practiced kicking more than 100 times, which is the basic movement of Taekwonmu. I was tired of monotonous movements, but I was more confident in practicing kicking than anyone else, so I was able to easily learn the difficult movements derived from kicking. After these efforts, I was nicknamed the ""dancing queen"" by Mongolian children. I will contribute to the healthy change of Korea along with the Korea Yakult by demonstrating my own abilities, which have been strengthened with solid basic skills. ""Building a Healthy World with Korean Yakult"" As IT convergence, an convergence between IT and other industries, is actively taking place, I realize that IT is indispensable in the industry. I majored in industrial engineering and was fascinated by IT that supports the smooth operation of the industry, and I applied to create a healthy world with Korean Yakult. I have developed two competencies to be reborn as a talented person suitable for the Korea Yakult IT job. ""First, competencies required to carry out tasks."" IT personnel must have development skills as well as an understanding of the industry. During my undergraduate years, I developed the ability to grasp the characteristics of the industry sharply by working on various projects that combine IT and industry, such as ""Smart Factory Design Using Cloud Computing"" and ""Improvement of Inventory Management System for Clothing Stores."" I decided that the foundation of IT was data, and I majored in statistics to learn in-depth about data processing and analysis. While learning statistical programming such as SAS or R, I developed numerical analysis skills. After completing the undergraduate program, I took a course to train applied SW and DB engineers at the OOO Institute of Education and learned various IT knowledge such as Java, HTML5, JSP, JQuery, Java Script, Oracle, Spring Framework, and MyBatis. By using the knowledge I learned, I developed practical skills by conducting development projects such as ""Free Video Lecture Site"" and ""Second, Used Auction Site."" ""Second, Competencies Required for Work Life."" After working as an intern at OO Research for six months, I learned the basics of work life that are trivial, but should never be overlooked.For example, I realized that it is more important to ask questions immediately and to learn exactly what you have been instructed to do, and to give prompt and correct outcomes, rather than to reverse the situation by yourself if there is a blockage. I will realize my dream of building a healthy society with the Korea Yakult based on my IT experience that I have challenged so far. Mrs. Yakult is a key competitive advantage of Korean Yakult in that it is Mrs. Yakult that the direct link between the seller and the consumer of Korean Yakult is Mrs. Yakult. However, I think there is a limit to door-to-door sales for modern people who are so busy that the new term ""time poor"" is emerging. This is because more and more people are using hypermarkets or online shopping due to their busy schedule. As a countermeasure, I came up with a way to activate the Korean Yakult mobile app. If you set a desired date and time through the app and meet Ms. Yakult, I think you can maximize the convenience of customers while maintaining the advantage of door-to-door sales that allows them to hear product information in person. In addition, if we add intuitive and convenient functions such as voice recognition and simple payment system for middle-aged and elderly people who are not familiar with using the app, I think Korea Yakult will be able to become a company loved by all customers of all ages. ""Real-time Inventory Management System for Customer Health"" Unlike general industrial products, food products should be more careful than anything else in managing their inventory because product defects are directly related to consumer health. This is because dairy products have a short shelf life of about 12 days, so it can be very fatal if inventory occurs. In the case of Cold Brew, we have a strategy of selling it only for 10 days after roasting, so it is also being sold at major department store food halls to secure additional sales channels. Since it is being sold through various channels, it is expected that there will be difficulties in managing inventory. To solve this difficulty, we devised a program for a display that outputs real-time inventory information in conjunction with the SCM, or a program for a device that immediately checks product information such as inventory and updates the changed inventory information in real time. We will improve the management efficiency of Korean Yakult by designing the envisioned program ourselves and contribute to the health of all customers who love Korean Yakult."
"The Korea Federation of Saemaul Geumgo, which promotes maximum customer satisfaction through bio-certification and simple services, is an ideal company to realize my dream of contributing to the happiness of all customers of all ages. We will develop a second MG mobile bank with the Korea Federation of Saemaul Geumgo, which actively responds to the future financial IT environment such as upgrading information integration system and establishing an IT center, to practice the warmth of embracing 'people'. I hope to develop an app. Seeing my parents who have difficulty issuing public certificates, I thought that I would like to develop an app that includes voice recognition function to give convenience to the middle-aged and the elderly who are not familiar with using the app. In order to implement the envisioned app directly, trust with customers who are app users and expertise in developing IT services are required. I learned this by developing survey pages in OO Research. In order to maximize the user's convenience, I gained trust by asking for feedback from my team members several times, and gained expertise by learning various IT knowledge such as MyBatis, Spring, and JSP. We will work with the Korea Federation of Saemaul Geumgo to realize the app we envisioned as a trusted and professional employee. In preparation for the ""Bright Energy"" contest, I encouraged my team members with bright energy. We prepared a surprise snack for the team members who were tired of a series of overnight meetings, and we completed the preparation for the contest safely within the period by exerting our rechargeable energy by eating snacks and talking. At that time, the team members nicknamed me 'the energizer', saying they had never seen a bright friend like you. By working on the ""Cooperation"" and ""Improvement of the in-school course registration system"", we showed cooperation and obtained the final evaluation result from the 7th place in the interim evaluation to the 2nd place. A team member who was an revenge major student was left behind due to his lack of basic UML knowledge. I delivered a note that I had organized the points for the team member and helped them with Q&A. It was a little difficult at first, but as a result of steadily helping them learn, they did it by themselves, and as a result, they drew everyone's participation without a single fallback. ""Responsibility"" I worked part-time at an academy for a year and prepared class by arriving 20 minutes in advance each time. Even after class, I helped with the Q&A through messenger, and most of the students I taught improved by an average of 5 points or more. I was even offered a regular teacher, saying that I was the first teacher who had never been late. ""Speed"" I tend to speak faster when I am nervous or excited. On the day of the graduation project presentation, professors of my department said that it would have been a better presentation if I had slowed down my speech a little. I am trying to organize things in my head and talk calmly before I speak out to convey my words. I get excessive stress when I fail to fulfill my ""strong desire to win."" After finishing second out of six teams in a sports competition when I was a freshman, I couldn't get my hands on things all day, which hindered my studies. In order to overcome my shortcomings, I try to look at the situation with positive thinking and confidence that another good thing will come soon, even if I experience a series of failures. ""Irgent personality"" There are times when I feel pressure from people around me due to my urgent personality. When I prepared for the fall conference, I felt nervous because I saw signs of being a little behind schedule. This urgent personality put unexpected pressure on other team members. In order to ease the burden on each other, I decided to help my team members after finishing my task quickly rather than just watching and getting nervous. I took the first step as an IT manager by taking an applied SW engineer training course at the OOOO Institute of Education. I experienced a sense of responsibility in planning, designing, and developing various projects such as 'Free Video Lecture Site' and 'Second-hand Auction Site' and developed my communication skills in the process of gathering opinions from team members. As I engaged in development with the user's convenience at every button location, my dream as an IT manager became firm and I gained confidence in the development. ""First Social Experience, OO Research"" While working as an intern at OO Research, I learned the basics of company life that are trivial, but should never be overlooked. For example, when I received a task, I realized that it was more important to ask immediately and to get the exact instructions and give the right results rather than to reverse the task by myself if there was a blockage. ""Mongolian Overseas Service Created through Collaboration"" An unexpected problem occurred while I was volunteering to install a garbage dump in OOO Ger 2-dong, Mongolia, with only five days left until the departure date. At first, I thought it would be impossible, but I was able to complete the service safely within a period of time thanks to the power of 24 members without a single alien. Through this, I learned the power of collaboration and have grown into a person who practices collaboration. ""The number of participants in the OOO Supporters event increased by 200%."" Judging that the main purchasing group was not limited to university students, the venue was changed to a downtown area and the number of participants increased by 200%. An event was held in Myeong-dong under the concept of 'OO Game with OOO' by parodying the hit movie Avengers at the time. The event, which was planned with the team members from one to ten, such as selecting a place and purchasing goods, was well received by more than 400 people. Since then, I have gained confidence that there is nothing I cannot do if I have a spirit of challenge that is not afraid of change. ""Central Inventory Management System where Everyone is Convenient"" With the experience of various projects, I have the ability to make people's lives more convenient by adding creativity to the technology I have learned. For example, a central inventory management system was proposed by demonstrating creativity in the 'Clothes Store Inventory Management Improvement Project'. When using the online clothing store, there was an inconvenience of having to contact the store directly to check the inventory.In order to solve this problem, we suggested benchmarking the OOO service, which is a method of receiving orders collectively from the center and delivering order information by store. To differentiate it from the OOO service, we added a function to recommend nearby stores by identifying the location of customers through GPS location-based services. It received favorable reviews from the professor in charge for its efficiency in operating the company and the system that satisfies the needs of customers. Through financial IT services based on creative thinking, we will become a creative central member of the Saemaul Geumgo Central Association that quickly relieves customer inconvenience and delivers true impressions."
"I think the ""challenge"" challenge is the process of growing and trying to achieve the goal with a clear goal. I always thought about and practiced what would be related to the goal in order to improve from now on. Representatively, I was able to approach my goal of being a Back-End developer by gaining experience in internship, IT club, hackathon, etc. During the four-month internship period, I decided to intern because I wanted to know deeply about Back-End. While carrying out related training and projects, I was able to do various projects related to RESTful API and Spring. In the case of Spring, it was difficult because it was my first learning skill, but through books and internet lectures, I learned and practiced the Front Controller pattern, AOP and DI, and became interested in it. Since then, I have developed my Back-End skills by working on projects such as ""SFTP File Transmission/Reception Process Construction"" and ""Approval History Inquiry System"". As such, I grew through internship and I was able to get closer to my goal. Even after joining the company, I will develop my S/W development skills by challenging not only Back-End, but also cloud, large database, and Front-End. I will be a Back-End developer who can contribute to the development of applications to Hanwha S&C. I have experience in strengthening the solidarity of the team by exerting a sense of responsibility. When I was working in the development club, the project schedule was disrupted due to the personal circumstances of two team members. Since it was my first club activity at the time, I had a sense of responsibility to complete the project. Thus, in addition to my original role, Back-End development, I was in charge of Android development. Although I had no experience, I thought this would also be my asset, and I spared no sleep to meet the schedule. Seeing myself like this, my team members also completed their tasks even in difficult situations, and as a result, I was selected as an excellent team within the club. Through this, I built more trust with my team members and was able to proceed with the project together to this day. I will become a member of Hanwha S&C who can add vitality to the team with a sense of responsibility for the work I always take charge of. I have experienced difficulty in carrying out team projects in the wrong way of collaboration, ""not doing it separately."" From this experience, I learned that considering and solving problems together is one of the important factors of collaboration. At the time of the team project, there was a setback in the schedule due to the team member in charge of Back-End. It was because it was difficult to implement the algorithm due to the large number of exceptions. When we all thought about the problem together, we came up with an algorithm surprisingly easily. If we had thought about the problem together from the beginning, our team would have been able to complete the project within the schedule. From this experience, I learned that real collaboration is to do the best of the individual's task and to think about and solve the problem with the team members. I challenged myself with greed to do it alone, but I couldn't come up with a proper idea, but I was able to solve it with the help of my team members. From this experience, I realized that it is important to trust and actively communicate with your team members when you have difficulties. I gained job experience through ""job experience"" interns, IT clubs, OOOs, seminars, etc. Based on this experience, I will quickly adapt to work and be put into practice to contribute. Through this experience, I learned Java, Python language, frameworks such as Spring, and Django, AWS cloud technology, and shape management tools such as Git, SVN, etc. In addition to the technical aspects, I have experienced writing documents, meetings, code reviews, and communication with other occupations, so I am confident that I will be able to integrate quickly into Hanwha S&C's development organization. While working on my ""growth potential"" personal project, I constantly tried to improve my development skills by refactoring. We mainly perform refactoring in terms of improving code object-oriented or applying newly learned technologies such as AWS. For example, I have experienced refactoring the 'department bulletin board notification' in the order of Socket, JSP, Spring, ORM, RESTful API, module separation, and AWS. I have tried to improve my development skills by applying various skills and knowledge learned through this experience to my actual code. Even after joining the company, I will not only organize my learning knowledge, but I will continue to grow as an S/W developer who can contribute to S&C by improving my development skills by applying it to personal projects. ""Innovation always exists around."" I think creative thinking is the most important thing at this point when ordinary companies are becoming digital transformation. We will be able to survive in the future market only when we create new business models by adding general industries and IT and have ICT technology. Therefore, creative thinking is based on Convergence IT, so I think it is an essential competency. I have experience in creating clothes search machines that combine artificial intelligence with existing shopping malls by participating in OOO. In general shopping malls, the only way to find the clothes you want is to search for keywords or find them yourself. However, I thought that if I could find clothes by image, it could give users a better experience. As a result, we developed the 'Clothes Search' using Microsoft's Cognitive API, and as a result, we were able to win the Excellence Award by tying for second out of 15 teams. Just as we carried out a project that can provide innovative convenience by incorporating artificial intelligence into the common shopping mall industry, I would like to cultivate Hanwha S&C's Convergence IT through continuous research in various fields."
"In high school, I became interested in the information security job after being hacked a few times because I was ignorant of security. As I entered the university with the OOO department, I learned what kind of work I was doing by subdividing the information security work, and I applied for the information security work because I thought that checking system vulnerabilities fits well with my meticulous and planned personality. The necessary competency in my opinion is the ability to use the understanding of new vulnerability information and related knowledge to check the in-house system. I have built up the foundation through my major study to understand various vulnerability information. I can be confident that my understanding of majors such as system security, network security, big data application security, security control, and mobile security, which I have studied and presented in the last two years, is higher than that of others. Among them, in the subject of Mobilesw Security, there was a time to research and present about mobile vulnerability checklists one part at a time, and I was in charge of the subject of Buffer Overflow. After that, I went out as an intern at a security company for two months as an on-the-job training, and based on my presentation, I had the experience of analyzing how to actually be exported from a weak application called Easy RM to MP3 Converter. In addition, I am currently studying to obtain an information security industry engineer license in order to acquire more practical knowledge, not just the experience of obtaining an information processing engineer license and studying the department. In the future, it is said that due to the 4th Industrial Revolution, not only fast delivery using drone delivery, but also 3D printers will be placed at consumers' homes and products that customers need can be manufactured and used at the same time as ordering. I want to become an expert in charge of CJ O Shopping's security by being able to acquire knowledge of vulnerabilities and wireless network security due to the development of IoT and AI, and respond to attacks using new technologies. When I took a course called Big Data Application Security, I worked on a team project for a little more than a month. The theme was a technique simulation to track ip spoofing, and in the process, it was divided into four parts: Python, Hadoop, R, and Arena. At that time, it was divided into three teams by random drawing, but compared to other teams, our team was not passionate and was working hard only on the part that we were in charge of like an individual project. Looking at the overall flow, it was judged that the final result would be very low in completion and would not receive good grades at this rate. It was my role to analyze the correlation between ip headers using R, but after finishing that part, I organized the ip tracback technique, executed the initial Arena sample model formed by another team member to inform the team members of the wrong point, read the data to be presented by other team members in advance, and advised them to fix it. As a result of such active efforts, other team members have also activated and cooperated in group chat rooms. As a result of the team project, I was able to get good grades, and I was able to feel proud when I heard indirectly from other team members that it was good to see that they were working hard. Until I worked on this project, I was not the type to be active and lead in the team at all. Until now, the experience of overcoming the limitations was that I had made efforts to improve myself, but through this experience, I was able to overcome my passive attitude and lead all of my team members to participate, so it was the most impressive experience to overcome the limitations."
"Due to the recent Fourth Industrial Revolution, the general public's interest in IT has increased, and various new technologies have emerged. Among them, smart products using AI home appliances, IoT, and robots may be LG's biggest competitiveness. When I was taking an IoT platform security class as an undergraduate of security, I researched about LG's IoT security strategy. It has been found that LG Electronics operates the 'LG Electronics Always Security Vulnerability Analysis Center' to create its own vulnerability checklist and conduct mock hacking. As I learned about system, network, and application vulnerabilities and encountered security incidents, I thought that creating and checking vulnerability checklist and checking system safety fit well with my meticulous and planned personality, so I applied. I want to apply in the security field. While attending the Department of Cybersecurity, I tried to maintain my grades in the top 30 percent by completing IT major class such as computer structure, computer network, database, and algorithm, and security major class such as system security, network security, big data application security, security control, and mobile security. In the system security class, we conducted a project to hook system call using language c. I received a close perfect score by hooking a function called sys_clone to improve the phenomenon that the system dies when the fork() function is called indefinitely in user mode. In network security, I have experience in creating a program in which the client and server communicate securely using a hybrid encryption system using language c. In the big data application security class, I received high scores by analyzing the correlation between fields using ip header data of large logs using R and conducting a team project that simulates the ip tracback technique using Arena. In the security control class, I have experience in creating detection rules using IPS, IDS, DDX equipment of real security companies and practicing whether virtual DoS attacks are actually detected. In the mobile security class, I was able to learn 26 criteria for software security weaknesses through the mobile public service security weakness check guide provided by the Ministry of Government Administration and Home Affairs. Based on this, I have experience in creating buffer overflows in real vulnerable applications when I went on a field trip to a company. I want to work on LG's IoT security. According to the Future Promising Technology Research Institute in 2017, the smart home appliance sector, which LG is increasing its investment, is one of the areas of living environment that will emerge over the next 10 years. In other words, it means that new security incidents could occur in the smart home appliance sector over the next 10 years. Right after joining the company, I would like to check the equipment, networks, and systems established in-house and make sure that the security vulnerability inspection guidelines provided by the Financial Security Agency, the Ministry of Government Administration and Security, and Kisa are being followed. In addition, we will prepare for security incidents that may occur by diligently learning about IoT services and smart home appliances being prepared by LG. To do so, we will study IoT equipment, wireless environment, and embedded Linux and prepare by introducing secure lightweight encryption and authentication technology. In addition, I want to become a talented person who can be harmonized with future business by frequently accessing new security trends and papers related to new technologies and attending security-related seminars."
"""Energetic applicant"" I am a bright and sociable applicant. My mother influenced me greatly in the way I formed my personality. My mother ran a piano academy, so my house was always full of friends my age. After my mother finished her class, I spent time with my friends, playing ddokji and ddakji. I naturally grew up to be a bright and sociable personality. My hobby is bowling. I enjoy bowling every two times a month. When I have a hard day, I step to the bowling alley with excitement that 'Bowling will relieve all of my fatigue.' As expected, with the falling pins, I feel the stress from the past is relieved at once. ""Collaboration, my own growth DNA."" My growth DNA is 'collaboration.' While engaged in outdoor activities with different team members and working as an intern for the first time as a social experience, I felt that 'the power of collaboration is greater than that of an excellent person.' Since then, I have been practicing collaboration by using collaboration as my growth DNA. By collaborating on the 'Improving the Course Application System' project, I received 7th place in the interim evaluation and 2nd place in the final evaluation. To make matters worse, there was a team member who was left behind when the team member who was PM due to early employment was neglected. Judging that the final result would not be produced within the period if the team member was overlooked, I delivered reference materials, helped with Q&A, and filled in the shortcomings of the team member. As a result, I was able to get the second place result in the final evaluation, which was a whopping five steps higher than the interim evaluation. Even after joining Hansol Intcube, I will continue to work together to share and lead the difficulties of my colleagues to create results. ""Fruit 'Challenge' with the root of 'Teamwork' When I worked as OOO supporters, I tried the challenge of changing the venue to a downtown area and achieved a 200% increase in participants based on the teamwork. Skin Food Supporters have been promoting new products at selected universities. The target of the existing event was a university student. Judging that the main purchasing group was not limited to college students, I suggested moving the venue to a downtown area and expanding our target. This innovative idea was accepted, and we held an event in Myeongdong under the concept of the hit movie ""The Avengers."" The event, which was organized with the team members from one to ten, such as selecting a place, designing, and purchasing items, ended with a great response from about 250 people. Due to the solid roots of ""teamwork,"" we were able to safely wrap up the event within the schedule despite a sudden change of venue. With this teamwork, we will produce countless ""challenges"" at Hansol Int'Cube. I had the experience of failing in a contest where I challenged myself under the theme of ""People with Open Ears"" and ""Provisions for 5G-based Connected Cars."" As everyone was greedy to win the competition, they couldn't help but disagree and spent nearly three weeks deciding on the topic. As a result, we had to hold overnight meetings one week before the submission period due to disruptions to our schedule. In the end, we failed to produce highly completed results and experienced the bitter pain of losing the match. Through this experience, I realized the importance of listening to and gathering the opinions of the other person. I will become an open-eared member of Hansol Int'Cube. ""Secondhand auction site made by myself"" The final project to train SW engineers was developed. The goal of the project was to develop a site where you can purchase used items at the price you want. For safe transactions, which is the main focus, I planned a 'manager virtual account' that temporarily manages the amount deposited by the buyer until the buyer receives the item, and an e-mail authentication and mobile phone authentication process. I was in charge of linking membership DB such as membership registration, information modification, withdrawal, and login, and membership event functions. When I clicked the email authentication button, I searched the MEMBER table through AJAX to check whether it was duplicated or not, and if there was no email, I sent the authentication number. Mobile phone authentication used Open API. Membership was graded based on the number of transactions in the last three months. Transactions that are past three months were deleted from the AUCTION table, and the company used Quartz technology to readjust the rating every day on the first day of each month. Since three of the four team members were non-majors, we studied for one hour every day to overcome the limitations of the knowledge we encountered. I conducted personal learning through Toby's Spring book and Googling, and absorbed what I learned while working on the study. As a result, I received positive reviews that the site was well-implemented enough to be sold to the instructor right away. I gained three things from this experience. First, it is the practical experience of IT, second, the power of teamwork, and third, the attitude of working on development from the user's perspective. Now, I will show all of these at Hansol Int'Cube. ""Innovative Workers who will entertain the world with Hansol Int'Cube"" With the experience of various projects, they have the ability to make people's lives more convenient by adding creativity to their mined technology. For example, we proposed a central inventory management system by showing creativity in the 'Improving Inventory Management System for Large Clothing Stores' project. When using online clothing stores, there was an inconvenience of having to contact the store directly to check the inventory. Since it is difficult to link the order information DB and the inventory DB in real time, we decided that it was not difficult for companies to do so. To solve this problem, we proposed a central inventory management system, which is a method of delivering order information received from the central government by store. In order to differentiate it from the existing system, we added a function that recommends stores close to the customer's location through GPS location-based service. As a result, there was a lot of admiration among the students about how they could come up with this idea, and I enjoyed the joy of winning first place in the creativity category along with the favorable reviews of the professor in charge of the innovative system that can be sold right away.In order to deliver a true impression to customers by competing with various existing IT services, I think creativity must be added to the service. With IT services based on creative thinking, we are ready to support Hansol IntiCube, an IT company that has more than 15 years of know-how in the field of contact center and wireless Internet solutions. Hansol IntiCube will become an Innovative Worker that can be the cornerstone for pioneering new digital content markets. ""Co-growth with Hansol IntiCube"" I supported the growth of Hansol IntiCube, which is growing into the top professional company in the IT solution field. I want to achieve joint growth at Hansol IntiCube, which strives to become a mature company where 'customers', 'shareholders', and 'employees' can be satisfied, grow, and contribute to society together. In order to perform SW development work at Hansol IntiCube, we have an understanding of business and development capabilities. In order to clearly reflect users' needs in SW, they must have an understanding of the business they run. I have learned methodologies such as object orientation and CBD by working on various projects that combine IT and business, such as 'How to build a smart factory using cloud computing' and 'Improving inventory management systems for clothing stores'. I have developed the ability to understand users' businesses by expressing systems that reflect requirements in modeling languages such as use cases, ERD, and DFD. Development capabilities are required in order to develop software that is easy to use and easy to expand functions. I developed my development capabilities by conducting development projects for 'Free Video Lecture Site' and 'Secondhand Auction Site' based on the Spring Framework in the Applied SW Engineer Training. In addition, I acquired a SQL Developer Certification for SW development considering not only the accuracy of data but also its usability, and developed my SQL writing capabilities. By demonstrating the capabilities I have learned, I will achieve customer satisfaction and shared growth with Hansol Inticube as the first-class quality."

A+ # 2017 Capstone Design 1 ? A+ * Developers who don't know about giving up."" Last July, I participated in the hackathon and realized the importance of the spirit of challenge. We didn't have enough time because we had to create the perfect program in about 30 hours. Our team had a hard time planning the idea, but decided to develop a program that can find clothes with images. Since the existing method of finding clothes with keywords has difficulty in expressing unstructured thoughts, we developed a 'Clothes Search' to find clothes faster and more accurately. My role was to develop REST API using Vision API and image crawling for early data learning. During the development process, we had difficulties in learning images. Vision API works based on tags. So, when you learn an image, you have to insert a specific tag together. It was inefficient for developers to allocate all tags of more than 1000 images directly, so we had to find an efficient way. We found a way to obtain tags for images by analyzing Vision API and tried to apply it, but we needed a separate identifier called Tag ID to learn. We solved the problem by analyzing the API again to get the ID of the tag. At first, I thought it would not be possible to implement it. However, after analyzing the API without giving up, we were able to find a way to learn images. As a result, we were able to create a program that worked perfectly, and our team received an 'Excellent Award'. From this experience, I learned that the attitude to challenge without giving up is important. Even after joining the company, there will be many situations where the roles given to me are technically difficult. However, I will solve the problem by analyzing related technologies with the spirit of challenge as I am now."
"I majored in 'industrial engineering' and wanted to study various disciplines in related fields when I was a junior at university, so I chose 'design engineering' as my minor and completed it together. Industrial engineering is a study that designs and manages the production environment and systems of the entire industry to be optimized. I learned the ability to design and develop SW programs through C and C++ languages, and to handle data with SPSS and R programs based on my knowledge of statistics. After two years of accumulating basic knowledge of industrial engineering, I wanted to challenge a wider range of academic fields by incorporating design engineering, so I took design methodology and creative capstone design courses. When I first took the design course, I was not only inferior to the existing design engineering students, but I was also not able to handle design tools properly, and I was worried that my lack of knowledge would hurt other friends who were doing team-specific tasks, so I studied harder than them by attending the design tool academy after school. In addition, I suggested how to use sensors while designing apps or smart devices using various engineering knowledge, and I contributed to the team by using my own strengths by suggesting interfaces with knowledge of ergonomics and UX. As a result, I got excellent grades in almost all design subjects. After graduating from college, I went to the Department of Computer Systems at the OOO Technical School and studied computer hardware and software programming. I obtained six computer-related certificates in one year, and I was selected as an excellent student and even went to Taiwan to train. When I was a senior at university, I served as the team leader for a year preparing for my graduation work. The theme of my graduation work in the subject of 'Industrial Engineering Capstone Design' was 'Selecting the Location of a Hub for Optimization of Blood Logistics'. To this end, I decided to collect the necessary data and use the R program to create a cluster of hospitals and produce PPTs. So, I shared the work by considering the strengths and circumstances of the team members, and a friction occurred between the class who collected the data and the class who produced the PPT while the work was progressing by exerting their abilities. The class who collected the data was that the PPT content was poor compared to the effort he made, and the class who produced the PPT was also hurt his pride because his efforts were not recognized. As a leader, I listened to them enough, and I conveyed to each other that there was a misunderstanding because I wanted to perform a task well even in a busy situation. At that time, I had time to finish my part, and I organized materials with my two classmates and supplemented the PPT and submitted my graduation work. Despite the trial and error, our team was selected as the outstanding team on campus and won the Silver Award at the SCM competition for Korean college students as a result of making concessions and respecting each other toward their goals. I was once a person who was 'generous to others and strict to me'. I learned that being considerate of others is a virtue, but not loving myself, my very minor problems made me feel constrained and intimidated. So I tried to control my mind by reading self-development books and humanities books. Meanwhile, I learned how to do 'artist date'. 'artist date' was once a week, by walking around the neighborhood or spending at least an hour doing what I wanted to do, or riding a bicycle to visit a library, an art museum, or a flower market to refresh my mood and take a rest. As a result, my stubborn mind softened, my thoughts became flexible, and I came to think creatively and variously. At that time, I was burdened with my studies by choosing a multi-major, and I had less confidence compared to other design engineering majors, but through ""Artist Date,"" I looked back on myself, saw and felt various things around me, and gained a little confidence. As a result, I was able to participate more actively in my studies by generating ideas freely in class, and above all, I came to be more considerate of others with a more sincere heart than before. As a sincere and creative talent who majored in industrial engineering and design engineering, I want to join Ko Young Technology's SMT inspection equipment software development department to research and develop inspection solutions and technologies. I can make desired programs using C language and C++ language, which are the basis of software development, and I have the ability to find meaningful statistics from data to reduce defect rates and find suitable solutions. In addition, I am confident that my idea of recognizing problems, seeking and attempting to find various solutions resembles the innovation of Ko Young Technology, which developed the world's first 3D AOI (part-mounted inspection device), which can contribute to the improvement and development of technology. Innovation is based on the basics and trust. Through vocational training, I have learned the basic principles of computers and soldering techniques step by step, and I think that the sharpness of meticulous observation of even the smallest parts is the basic and trust of precise technology, and this trust grows a company. If I join Ko Young Technology, I will continue to study actively and look at equipment and algorithms in new ways. I will understand the characteristics and core technologies of the equipment, understand them accurately, and suggest more precise and innovative technologies from a new perspective while listening to the advice of seniors. In 10 years, I will grow up to be a person who researches and manages the entire process from SW development of equipment to UX planning."
"The most important values in choosing a ""company that can grow and contribute"" are 'contribution' and 'growth potential'. I see if there is anything I can contribute to the company and if I can grow through the company. In this respect, I thought it was a great fit when I looked at the Zoom Internet. I have built up my Java Back-End development skills through experiences such as internships and development clubs. In particular, the experience of developing a new writing notification system through crawling, which was conducted as a personal project, will be the most helpful in understanding and performing tasks. In addition, development using MySQL and Python (Django) was also carried out in the club activities. Experiences like these will help you quickly acquire the knowledge you need for work. I think learning ability is important because there are many things to learn. When you learn the development stack that you use in the past more deeply and specifically than new things, you will be able to learn with much more pleasure and actively to achieve great efficiency. I was convinced that Zoom Internet is a company that values talented people and has an active communication culture. I think that thinking about talented people gives employees a sense of pride and responsibility, and communication enables co-prosperity. In this respect, I think Zoom Internet is a company with potential for growth. I saw an article during the job posting that said, 'It would be even better if you read these books and apply.' Recommend books to new developers in the future can be considered that you value people and the communication culture is activated. Therefore, I decided to apply for Zoom Internet as a company that can grow as a developer and be proud of itself, and become a developer who always dreams of developing in an atmosphere of communication. The advantage is that I have a strong sense of responsibility for ""responsibility in collaboration."" I think responsibility is essential in collaboration. I believe that the synergy of the team is further strengthened when performed responsibly for common tasks. I have experience of strengthening the solidarity of the team by exerting responsibility. When I was working in the development club 000, the project schedule was disrupted due to the personal circumstances of the team members. Since it was my first club activity at the time, I had a sense of responsibility to complete the project. Thus, I was in charge of Android development in addition to my original role, Back-End development. Although I had no experience, I thought this would also be an asset, and I spared no sleep to meet the schedule. Seeing this, the team members also completed their tasks even in difficult situations, and as a result, they were selected as the excellent team within the club. As a result, I built more trust with the team members and was able to proceed and complete the project together after the club activities. I will become a member of the Zoom Internet, which can always add vitality to the team with a sense of responsibility for my duties. The disadvantage is that I perform endlessly with a ""endless spirit of challenge."" I tend to neglect other tasks because I am busy doing what is in front of me. For example, when I was working on a personal project, I found an exception while writing the bulletin board crawling logic. The next day, I have an experience that I completely forgot that I had a class in the first period and struggled all night to solve that exception. Eventually, I couldn't concentrate on the class throughout the first period. As such, I always do my best in the immediate work, but I often go too far. However, I am trying to fix it by checking in advance what to do the next day and making a time plan. Through thorough time management, I will try to become a member of the Zoom Internet, which does not make mistakes in the second-ranked work. When I solved problems and improved the inconvenience of life through the software development of ""No. 1 Back-End Developers"", I felt proud and proud when I learned new skills and refactored them. Looking back on my undergraduate days, I showed the greatest concentration in problem-solving programming, project execution, and learning of new development knowledge, and it was interesting. Therefore, the software development job is the most suitable job and the job that I want to reach its peak. I want to grow as a Back-End development expert in the Back-End development team. When I was in second grade, I first learned web programming and became interested, so I aimed to become a Back-End developer by studying Spring Framework myself from JSP/Servlet. It has come to me as an attractive way to write business logic and provide APIs within the program. Interns and development club activities helped me the most in achieving my goals among the experiences I have tried so far. Working as an intern in charge of Back-End development, I learned the basics of Back-End development. In one month of job training, I learned the knowledge of Back-End and developed my Back-End development skills by using UML design, work process writing, collaboration with client developers, SVN, Jenkins, etc. It was an experience that I challenged myself because I wanted to learn clearly in practice and grow through feedback, not by myself. Along with the development of Back-End development, it became an opportunity to further increase interest and interest. In addition to this experience, I was convinced that Back-End was the most suitable development field for me, considering personality, interest, and aptitude. In that respect, the Chrome platform development job of the Zoom Internet is the job I want to challenge the most. I will become an S/W developer who can grow and contribute as a Back-End developer while developing a crawl platform. I gained job experience through ""job experience"" interns, IT clubs, hackathon, seminars, etc. Based on this experience, I am confident that I will quickly learn and contribute to my work. With this experience, I learned Java, Python language and framework, AWS, and Git, etc. In addition to the technical aspects, I have experienced document writing, meetings, and code reviews, so I am confident that I will learn better and do well in developing a crawl platform than anyone else. I tried to improve my development skills by constantly refactoring my ""led growth"" personal projects.Refactoring is performed mainly in the aspect of improving code or applying newly learned technologies in an object-oriented manner. For example, I have experience repactoring personal project 000 in the order of Socket, JSP, Spring, REST API, etc. I have been trying to improve my development skills by applying various skills and knowledge learned through this experience to my actual code. Even after joining the company, I will not just organize the knowledge I learn, but I will continue to grow as a software developer who can contribute to the Zoom Internet by improving my development skills by applying it to personal projects."
"Recently, I have been playing C.A.T.S. and FIFA Online 3M as mobile games. I have been enjoying playing FIFA Online 3M very much because it is linked to the PC version, but my current level is 92. C.A.T.S. is a game in which tanks are customized to fight against each other. It is currently up to the 14th stage of the championship. As for PC games, I often enjoy League of Legends and Starcraft, which is emerging again these days. Also, I am playing FIFA Online 3 that is linked to mobile the most. The job I applied for is game QA. Anyway, first of all, you have to understand and know the game well. I have encountered many kinds of games since I was young. I think this is advantageous for work compared to people who do not know the game well, because I have encountered almost everything I have done evenly. Second, I have worked on smart TV QA at an S/W testing company for about a year, and I think one of the things I felt during that period is persistence. Another important point in QA is persistence. I think QA work is a random bug, so there are tests that have to be repeated countless times. I think it is important to be patient when conducting such a test. Third is creativity. When I was doing QA work in my entire company, I often found bugs that other people didn't see. I used to get compliments from colleagues around me, and I think that's because creativity was shown. The most common nagging thing was to clean your room. But I think I always keep order in chaos, which is chaos. I have my own rules, and I always leave things in a convenient place to find. But anyway, I know that this is not good for others. So, I think that order in chaos is important, but also order in the outside is important, so I always keep thinking to myself to be organized well. If I can't remember exactly what kind of game it is, there was a mobile game I used to enjoy a lot in the past. I used to pay cash to recharge my heart, but it never came in properly. I always had to contact the customer center after I made the payment, and the heart came in. But it's not like that once, and every time I paid, I was really angry and asked, expressing anger at the inquiry. But the answer that came back was just a macro answer. If I were a service provider, I would judge that errors in cash payments are quite a big error, and I would sincerely apologize to customers and would not respond in a copy-and-paper manner. I think that kind of service is the shortcut to ruining the game. When I think of Nexon Networks, the word youth comes to mind first. I don't know exactly, but I heard that there are many young people, and when I came across them through various articles and game sites, I saw almost a lot of young people. I think youth is really important. I think the atmosphere of the company can change and there is a spirit of youth, so I want to join the spirit of youth. What I have experienced while working in QA is mainly in the broadcasting channel or TV field. Through this internship, I also experienced QA work in the game industry, and I look forward to working hard to be reborn as a regular employee. In my life, I have rarely had any problems because I always deal with interpersonal relationships in a leisurely manner. I have always maintained good interpersonal relationships because I think from the other person's point of view and try not to be offended. However, just as trouble will happen even if I stay still, sometimes the problem occurs, and in this case, I solve the problem by making a concession. If you're a person who gets into trouble with me, there's nothing good for each other when they bump into each other, so I think the best option is to just make concessions and say good things. When I was in college, I was planning and producing an automatic gas valve lock as my graduation work. However, I got a job when I was halfway through my work around summer vacation, and I went out for a job. At that time, I felt sorry for my friend who was working with me in groups of two. Fortunately, however, I felt a little relaxed because he also got a job, but I was able to come up with a more complete work by meeting him during my free time to raise the completeness of 50% to 80%. At this time, I thought that I could do everything I realized. I wondered if I could do well while I was busy, but anyway, I was satisfied and realized that I worked together with my friend to achieve better results."
"""Finding a business model through strategy and execution."" ""Strategic execution, strategy in action"" I think these are the words necessary for a company to grow. I think the current growth of Midas IT is also based on strategy and execution. We set Midas' own principles for growth and created our own spirit that must be equipped for the realization of core values and visions, and based on them, we established a systematic five-step work procedure. I think this strategy, which minimizes problems that arise in the process of performing tasks and increases the sense of belonging of employees, can serve as the cornerstone for the company's growth. If you have prepared enough strategies and foundations to enhance the work performance of your employees, I think you should establish a business strategy based on them and discover a business model that can make profits. Midas' business areas can be divided into software, engineering consulting, and e-Biz business. In the introduction of core technologies, there is an introduction saying, ""With our own technologies, we are informing the world of the excellence of Korean engineering technologies."" As such, the strategy of all business departments developing and selling core technologies without importing them from abroad has been so farI think it has become the foundation for SU to succeed. Companies with core technologies believe that their technologies can have infinite potential to grow into trees as their roots. For example, Alibaba in China is also expanding its scope to various fields such as cloud, fintech, and securities based on a service called an e-commerce platform. As in this case, I think Midas also created a business model based on the core technologies developed by himself. As a result, I think the foundation of Midas' growth was that he established the strategy of the company on which it was based and implemented it to develop core technologies. ""I am a developer with '○○'. ""As I have grown as a developer, I have a principle to become a responsible developer. Among the many competencies that I have to possess as a developer, I chose 'responsibility' because I think it is most necessary no matter what I perform. During my startup activities, I learned related technologies for 14 hours a day to learn Android technologies that I do not know well for app development. As a result, I showed a sense of responsibility to complete the development within the target time. In order to complete a task within such a given time, it is necessary to perform additional tasks as needed and return one's own time to learn skills, so I have grown up with the principle of becoming a responsible developer. ""The current energy production of passionate power plants is 50%."" I think those who plan and strategize software businesses need the same ability as power plants to challenge themselves with passion like power plants that generate electricity and to analyze market problems with a cool-headed gaze like a cooler. The passion that does not neglect anything has become the driving force to completely digest the contest, external activities, internship, and volunteer activities. Even if the contest fails by challenging with the spirit of the lacquerware, the suspicious contests came up with new ideas and proposed after the contest, the start-up activities that have been steadily conducted for nearly two years to identify market trends and learn S/W development skills, and the internship activities of researchers who presented a new paradigm that was not present in the existing market through medical and IT convergence are all the results of my efforts to sincerely carry out various activities with the enthusiasm for new challenges. Among them, the contest, which I challenged without giving up more than 20 times for the award, gave me an opportunity to grow my passionate power plant to the next level. I analyzed problems such as proposals and designs for ideas that were not awarded, not just supporting the contest."
"""The Future City Built with IBS"" Lotte Information and Communication has abundant experience in the field of intelligent building systems (IBS) and is leading the construction of smart buildings. Various IBS solutions have been developed that can provide a convenient environment to customers by integrating them with IOT technologies such as central control system, building energy management system, U-healthcare, smart card, and smart parking system. Recently, it has established an energy-saving system (LEMS) in conjunction with the IOT platform at the Busan Metropolitan Government Complex, and is expanding its business areas of IBS such as domestic and international complexes, shopping malls, hotels, and apartments. My goal is to develop convenient services for people by using IOT technology. Furthermore, it is my big dream to build a future city that is automatically controlled without much effort from people, and I think it is a must-have task in the future business. And I am confident that I can achieve my dream by building a future city through the accumulated IBS technology of Lotte Information and Communication. ""The path of a developer"" Since I was young, I have dreamed of becoming a developer following my father, who is a computer programmer. However, when I entered the computer department, I didn't know anything about development. I realized that making a computer program while listening to my major was not an easy task, so I went to the military after passing the first grade. Before returning to school after discharge, I learned my failed experiences in my freshman year and first came to see my friends who are studying in my major and made a commitment to improve my programming skills. In order to strengthen the basics step by step, I learned theories by watching internet lectures from C programming. The more I learned, the more I became interested in programming, and I wanted to learn other languages. I studied JAVA programming, C++ STL, and data structure programming by myself, and after the leave of absence period was over, I returned to school. When I applied the subjects I learned by myself according to the professor's professional education, my understanding became better, and in the first semester after returning to school, I was able to get A+ grades in all subjects. I applied for an intern because I wanted to apply my capabilities as a developer, and I learned various major programming skills such as network and data communication. The TSB software development department of Daegu Technopark worked on optimization of the system measurement algorithm and conversion of the development language. While working on the joint project, I was able to develop a sense of cooperation in the organization and the ability to communicate with my team members. I think I can successfully complete the project if I use my cooperation and communication skills in Lotte Information and Communication. I worked as a serving and barista for two years in a restaurant called ""Consideration and Responsibility Learned by Part-time Jobs"". Since I had no experience working part-time before, I didn't get used to my work, and I made many mistakes, so I was often scolded by the boss. I thought about whether serving was inappropriate for me, and I thought about whether I should find another job. However, I had a motto not to give up on anything, so I decided to do it until I could. As time passed, I became better at serving, and I became able to become a barista as a dessert business proficient. Among the part-timers I worked with, when I became the best, the boss, who was scolding me at first, began to acknowledge it, and I took charge of the manager who manages the restaurant part-timers. As I became a manager, I began to feel a sense of responsibility as a manager. Previously, I did what I was told to do, but when I was told to do the work, I learned that I had to take responsibility for it. I started to act independently in everything in the restaurant like my own store, and I came to think about how to satisfy the service for customers who came to the restaurant. I introduced the recommended menu to customers who came for the first time, and for customers who came often, I tried to listen to the customer's hard work by recognizing the menu first and asking them in advance what they ate often. I started to have regular customers who came on purpose because they liked my service, and I felt the joy and reward of working. The mind of caring for customers first was applied throughout my daily life, and I was always considerate when I met people. ""I didn't give up and overcame my weaknesses through various attempts."" I was embarrassed by an unexpected problem, but I had an experience of overcoming it. At the embedded research center in the school, I formed a team with my friends and participated in the IOT project contest. As a detailed theme of the project, I conducted a project called 'Autonomous Driving of Electric Bicycle Cluster'. It was a project to autonomously maintain the distance between bicycles through Arduino signals after measuring the distance between bicycles with a mobile phone GPS during the platooning of electric bicycles. A problem occurred while I was developing the speed control part of the electric bicycle. I tried to adjust the speed value using the software of the electric bicycle, but there was a problem that the value could not be changed in real time due to compatibility between Arduino and the electric bicycle software. I thought a lot about solving the problem, but I came to the conclusion that it was difficult to solve it with the knowledge I knew. However, if the speed control function could not be implemented, the project could not proceed, so I couldn't give up. So, I tried various attempts to solve the problem. I contacted the company of the electric bicycle I purchased and tried to obtain information on the electronic circuit diagram of the electric bicycle. By analyzing the electronic circuit diagram and sending the signal by directly connecting it to the throttle and brake control part of the Arduino and electric bicycle, I was able to finally complete the project by successfully adjusting the speed of the electric bicycle. Taking this experience as a foothold, if I face an unexpected problem in the course of the project, I will not give up and try from various perspectives. So, I will do my best to solve the problem without fail. ""The future city built with IBS of Lotte Information and Communication"" We will apply IBS to all buildings of Lotte affiliates, and further contribute to the construction of a future city applied with IBS technology of Lotte Information and Communication.To this end, I will learn various IBS solutions that accumulate the know-how of Lotte Information and Communication and the LEMS system linked with the IOT platform at the beginning of joining the company. And I will try to become a developer who communicates with team members. In 5 years, I will try to understand the needs of customers and develop necessary IBS solutions. And as IOT technology develops, we will establish a security solution that becomes more important to prepare for hacking and malicious programs. In 10 years, as the project manager, I will do optimization work to build an efficient IBS system. I am confident that the establishment of an IBS future city will be the stepping stone for Lotte Information and Communication's globalization, and I also want to achieve my dream of building a future city that becomes more convenient for people."
"""Dream to Build Smart Buildings"" Lotte Information and Communication has abundant experience in the field of intelligent building systems (IBS) and is leading the construction of smart buildings. Various IBS solutions have been developed that can provide a convenient environment for customers by integrating them with IOT technologies such as central control systems, building energy management systems, and smart parking systems. It has established an energy-saving system (LEMS) in conjunction with the IOT platform at the Busan Metropolitan Government Complex, and is expanding its business areas of IBS such as complexes, shopping malls, hotels, and apartments at home and abroad. The IBS system is also applied to Lotte World Tower, which is recently scheduled to open, and Lotte Information and Communication's IBS technology will be applied to more buildings in the future. I dream to build a future city that is automatically controlled without much effort by people, using IOT technology, and I think it is a must-have task in the future business. I want to achieve my dream by building a future city by utilizing the accumulated IBS technology after joining Lotte Information and Communication. ""The path of a growing developer"" Since I was young, I have dreamed of becoming a developer following my father, who is a computer programmer. However, when I entered the computer department, I had no idea about development. I realized that making a computer program while taking my major was not easy, so I went to the military after finishing the first grade without receiving good grades. After being discharged from the military, I decided to improve my programming skills by watching my friends who are studying their major by returning to school first and experiencing failure in the freshman year. To learn the basics, I learned theories by watching internet lectures from C programming. The more I learned, the more I became interested in programming, and I wanted to learn other languages. I studied JAVA programming, C++ STL, and data structure programming by myself, and after the break period ended, I returned to school. Listening to the professor's class, applying the programming techniques I learned by myself improved my understanding, and in the first semester after returning to school, I was able to get A+ grades in all subjects. After that, I learned various major subjects such as network and data communication, and I grew as a developer, and I interned to learn programming that was practically applied in the company. The software development team of Total Softbank carried out a joint project to optimize the system measurement algorithm and convert the development language. While working on the joint project, I learned how to communicate and cooperate with my team members. I will try to successfully carry out the project using my cooperation and communication skills in Lotte Information and Communication. I worked as a serving and barista for two years at a restaurant called ""Consideration and Responsibility Learned by Part-time Work"". Since I had no experience working part-time before, I didn't get used to my work, and there were many days when the boss scolded me because there were many mistakes. I thought about whether serving was inappropriate for me and wondered if I should find another job. However, I had a motto not to give up on anything, so I decided to do it until I could. As time passed, I became able to serve well little by little and become proficient in working as a barista for dessert. When I became the best at work among the part-timers I worked with, the boss, who scolded me at first, began to recognize me, and I took charge of the manager who managed the restaurant part-timers. As I became a manager, I began to feel a sense of responsibility as a manager. Previously, I did what I was told to do, but when I was told to do the work, I learned that I had to take responsibility for it. I started to act independently in everything in the restaurant like my own store, and I came to think about how to satisfy the service for customers who came to the restaurant.

And I will try to become a developer who communicates and collaborates with team members. In 5 years, I will become a real developer of the project. I will try to understand the needs of customers and develop IBS solutions that are essential to customers. And as IOT technology develops, we will build security solutions that become important to prepare for hacking and malicious programs. In 10 years, as a project manager, I will do optimization work to build an efficient IBS system. I am confident that the establishment of an IBS future city will be a foothold for Lotte information and communication's globalization and I want to achieve my dream of building a future city."
"I recommend the above student to be an intern at your university. OOO students have excellent academic performance and perform faithfully with responsibility for their duties. And they have good teamwork skills. As a result, when I carried out the graduation project, I cooperated well with my team members and received the Excellence Award at the SW Convergence Project Performance Presentation.

Currently, I am studying with an emphasis on web development and am working on a project linked to Mysql DB using JavaScript. Based on this, I would like to contribute to the establishment and operation of the management information system, appraisal and compensation management system of the Korea Appraisal Board."
"I have a personality of being considerate of the other person and a spirit of challenge that does not give up. ""Don't give up and challenge."" My life value is 'Let's not give up in any difficulties'. I participated in the IOT competition under the theme of 'Electric Bicycle Cluster Self-Driving'. While smoothly working on the project, a problem occurred due to the compatibility of Arduino and electric bicycles. I thought a lot about it to solve the problem, but it was difficult to solve it with the knowledge I knew. However, I did not give up and tried to solve the problem. I contacted the electric bicycle company I bought to get information about the electronic circuit diagram, and I was able to complete the project by sending signals to the control part of the electric bicycle directly through Arduino. Taking this experience as an opportunity, I came to have 'Let's not give up' as a value and I gained confidence that I can solve any adversity I face in the future. 'Consideration for the other person' I always consider the other person when dealing with a person. I wasn't considerate personality from the beginning, but it changed when I was a manager at a restaurant for two years. I worked to entertain customers and tried to satisfy customers. We introduced the recommended menu to the first-time guests, and the frequent visitors asked in advance what they ate frequently, and we accepted the customer's efforts. As I worked while being considerate of the customers, I naturally came to be considerate of the other person. Being considerate of the other person helped me coordinate my opinions while working on a team project, and my sense of cooperation improved accordingly. I will contribute to achieving a common goal by demonstrating cooperation when working on a project at Hanwha System. ""Pride for National Security"" I think the defense industry is a key project that the state should invest in for the security of the country. Hanwha System is leading the defense industry of the country such as radar-electron optics, command and control and communication systems, and marine weapons systems. It is a leading company in the defense industry of Korea with accumulated know-how and superior technology in the field of precision electronics and software. I applied because I wanted to work with the pride and passion of protecting my family and the country by contributing to the improvement of future defense technology by taking charge of SW at Hanwha System. ""Effective system integration"" I will strive to improve the integration technology of the ship combat system. Hanwha System was selected in competition with LIG for the KF-X system AESA radar development project. I think Hanwha System's system integration technology is the competitiveness that is ahead of its competitor LIG. If I join Hanwha System's SW department, I will analyze the current system by receiving Hanwha System's accumulated know-how in system integration technology in the short term. And I will create Hanwha System that shows the status of No. 1 in the defense industry in Korea by establishing algorithms and communication systems that can be effectively applied to system integration in the long term. In order to develop SW capabilities, students can use C, C++, and JAVA languages through undergraduate major studies and projects, and they have developed various programming skills such as network. Algorithm, Linux programming, and Arduino programming. And I improved my working-level project skills through internship and contest. ""Efficient Server Establishment"" I worked as an intern at embedded research center and developed V2X in-school vehicle system servers. I researched for efficient server construction, and as a result, I built an IOCP-type server that is the most used in the game industry, the most efficient server. In order to build an IOCP server, I learned a lot of server network knowledge and also worked on tuning the MySQL database to increase server efficiency. And for practical network test, we developed the MFC program so that other people can test it easily. ""Cooperative spirit gained through the joint project"" I was the team leader in the graduation project of the regional leading project. I proceeded with a project to provide coupons using beacons to small business owners in Daehak-ro. As the team leader, I implemented a beacon recognition module and Android socket communication using beacon API with the project general manager. And as the team leader of the joint project, I made a lot of efforts to cooperate with other schools. While working on the joint project, I learned the importance of teamwork, and I was able to learn how to efficiently carry out the project with other teams for a common goal. I will also contribute to the smooth progress of the joint project by demonstrating my cooperative spirit in the Hanwha system."
"""No.1 LG Leaps to Smart Factory"" My dream is to develop technology and create a world where people become more convenient through less labor. That's why I became attracted to the smart factory industry, which increases cost reduction effect and facility utilization rate through factory automation. LG CNS has accumulated know-how in building factory automation for more than 20 years and leads the smart factory industry by building manufacturing execution solution (ezMES), facility control solution (ezControl), and integrated control solution (ezUMS). I think IOT is important for smart factory technology in preparation for the 4th industrial revolution. I made an effort to become an IOT expert. I worked on several projects using Arduino and Beacon, and learned sensor utilization technology by interning at the embedded lab. And to gain IOT knowledge, I acquired the IOT Knowledge Competency Test certificate. I will contribute to the LG CNS smart factory industry moving forward globally by utilizing my IOT technology. I once participated in a project contest organized by the embedded lab on campus as a team with my friends. The theme was 'Smart Bicycle Cluster Driving Using BLE Beacons', which measures the current location coordinates of electric bicycles and the distance between the bicycles through GPS and beacon correction algorithms and displays the location of the bicycles on the mobile phone application. Arduino implemented an automatic speed control function that slows down electric bicycles when the distance between bicycles is closer than the reference distance and increases speed when the distance increases. I interned at the institute during the 3rd grade winter vacation in recognition of my achievements after the completion of the project. I worked to build an IOCP server for the V2X school vehicle safety system and DB test and error detection for the ESL electronic price indicator system. While interning, I was able to learn how the system I actually built was managed and learn how to cooperate with my colleagues. ""Global No. 1 Smart Factory Company"" We will apply LG CNS's smart factory technology to all manufacturing industries in Korea and further contribute to LG CNS' global leap forward. And we will build our big data, cloud, and IOT technology capabilities so that the smart factory industry can move forward in preparation for the Fourth Industrial Revolution. First of all, I will try to experience and understand smart factory solutions such as ezMES and ezControl of LG CNS for three years after joining the company. And I will study whether it is possible to build a smart factory in other manufacturing fields other than the solar, automobile, and logistics fields where the current smart factory is established. In addition, I will study whether it can be applied to smart factory solutions by improving cloud and IOT technology capabilities in preparation for the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Ultimately, in 10 years, by applying the accumulated cloud and IOT technology capabilities, LG CNS smart factory solutions will overwhelm Germany's smart factory technology and contribute to becoming the No. 1 LG CNS in the world."
"""Be considerate before speaking"" I always want to live a caring life. When I meet people, I try to be in the other person's position and figure out what that person wants. And I catch up and act without asking for what the other person wants. By feeling rewarded by seeing the other person's gratitude, I become more motivated and considerate of the other person. I worked part-time at a restaurant cafe called ""Manager of a Restaurant"" for two years. As I took over as manager, I started to manage regular customers. I tried to feel that I was receiving special treatment by asking in advance what my regular customers eat often or providing service food. As a result, customer satisfaction in the restaurant has increased and my skills to entertain customers have also increased. ""Barista Certificate"" I want to obtain a certificate by taking a practical test for barista certificate. I tried to obtain a barista second-level certificate with the experience of learning coffee at a restaurant cafe. However, I only passed the written test and prepared for the practical test, but I did not. There is a lot of regret that I did not finish what I could finish, so I want to get a certificate and finish it. ""Easy Financial Transaction Services"" I think the biggest issue in the current financial sector is FinTech. Many shopping malls and other banks are investing a lot in Pintet. Among them, an application called Toss gave me a big impression. Previously, I couldn't make any financial transactions without an accredited certificate, but the advantage of being able to send money by just knowing the contact information of the other party was a fresh shock to me. Since then, I have had a wish to make simple and more convenient services for people who have difficulty in financial transactions on the Internet. ""Must-have services for customers"" Although the Toss application has grown significantly, KB Kookmin Bank customers still use KB Star Banking. I found that Kookmin Bank has also developed and provided a LIV platform for convenient services for customers. It is not just about remittance, but also provides currency exchange and waiting ticket issuance services for customers. I find out what services are essential from the customer's point of view and what needs improvement. KB Kookmin Bank would like to add essential services in LIV to get high satisfaction from Kookmin Bank customers. ""From Grade 4 to Grade 1,"" I got a grade 4 in the math category during the mock test in June, when I was in high school. While I was struggling with my grade improvement, I found that the standard score in the math area, which was predicted to be relatively difficult, was higher than that of other subjects. So I thought that focusing on studying rules in the math area could improve my grades efficiently. During the time that there is not much time left until the SAT, I set my goal for the first grade in the math area and set a strategy to improve my grades. First of all, in order to solve various problems, I bought all the repair workbooks sold on the market and invested more than 10 hours a day in problem solving. I tried to get help for problems I didn't know, but I made a wrong answer note and mastered it repeatedly. At first, my grades didn't improve, but I didn't give up and kept on studying. At some point, my grades began to rise little by little, and I finally got the grade of first grade in the SAT. Having achieved a high grade improvement from grade 4 to grade 1, I made it my life's motto that there is nothing I can't achieve if I don't give up and invest my time and passion to try. And when I have a task to solve, I have an attitude that I don't give up and try. I teamed up with my friends to participate in a project competition organized by a research institute in the school. The theme was to identify the current location coordinates of bicycles and display them on mobile phone applications, using 'cluster driving using BLE beacons'. For work efficiency, we decided to do it by dividing it into server development, positioning algorithm, and hardware development. While the project was going smoothly, the positioning algorithm part of a friend was blocked, and the entire development was stopped. There was a problem that the distance between the bicycles in the cluster was measured, but the direction was not known. I stopped the part I was developing for a while and gathered my team members to solve this problem. I came up with an idea how to measure the angle of view using the vectors I learned in high school mathematics, and then implemented an algorithm to measure the angle of view by promoting the method with my friends. And I was able to complete the project by finally figuring out the direction of the cluster. I don't think there's anything I can do well on my own. I think that when we work together to form a team called 'we', our true individual abilities are also demonstrated. ""The ability to communicate"" If you can't communicate and empathize with the customers, I don't think you provided real service. I once went to eat out with my family at a famous restaurant. Perhaps because it was lunchtime on the weekend, there were a lot of people. I called an employee and ordered, but they were served with a clichéd order. The food at the restaurant was delicious, but it wasn't a satisfactory meal. On the other hand, I remember being happily greeted by the owner when I went to another restaurant with a friend. When I ordered, I was much more comfortable choosing the food because they explained the spicyity, the well-selling menu, and the taste of the food in advance, and I felt that I received the service well, so I remembered it as a satisfactory meal. If the customer's point of view does not sympathize properly, we cannot know the true service that the customers want. I will always try to actively accept the inconvenience from the customer's point of view and improve it so that I can get satisfaction. I want to contribute to the improvement of KB customer satisfaction by developing customized IT services for KB Kookmin Bank's customers."
"[Smart Home Built with IOT] I took a subject called Creative Basic Engineering Design during my undergraduate class. I made a presentation with the topic of research on future industries and was new to IOT. As a result of the research, I found that it is a great promising technology in the future, and large foreign companies such as MS and SISCO are already investing a lot in IOT. As I got to know about IOT, I became more and more interested and dreamed of building a smart home developed with IOT technology. LG Electronics developed a function to control IOT home appliances by using smart TVs applied with WebOS 3.0, and I think that they have the same goal of building a smart home. I applied because I wanted to achieve my dream of building a smart home by using LG Electronics' webOS technology. [Problem solving through the transition of ideas] In order to develop the IOT development ability, I thought project experience was important, so I challenged several contests and projects. As the most memorable project, I did a project called 'Autonomous Driving of Electric Bicycle Cluster' at an embedded lab in the school. It was a project to measure the distance between bicycles with mobile phone GPS and maintain them autonomously through Arduino signals when driving in groups of electric bicycles. A problem occurred while developing Arduino as he was in charge of the speed control part of the electric bicycle. I tried to adjust the speed value using the software of the electric bicycle, but there was a problem that the value could not be changed in real time due to compatibility between Arduino and the electric bicycle software. Various attempts were made to solve the problem, and the project could be completed using the change of idea of a direct connection between the electric bicycle circuit diagram and Arduino. Through this experience, I realized that a change of idea was necessary to solve the problem, and I also learned that IOT knowledge was lacking while trying various attempts. To compensate for this, I am studying by reading an IOT major book and am about to take the IOT Knowledge Competency Test certificate. [LG Electronics as the center of the world's IOT] We will try to integrate and optimize the webOS 3.0 IOT service controlled by smart TVs. First of all, I will try to understand the technology of the smart home appliance system powered by webOS 3.0, the linked smart ThinkQ hub, and the sensor. Furthermore, we will work on a joint project with the MC division to link mobile phones and webOS. As a result, we will proceed with an application development project that can simply control and manage IOT home appliances in the home through webOS with a mobile phone. And as IOT technology develops, we will steadily supplement webOS security technology in preparation for the complementary problems that become more important. In the long run, we will try to make LG smart home service available to many people around the world so that LG Electronics can stand tall as the center of the world's IOT."
"I've never taken a subject whose main goal is SW test (hereinafter referred to as test), but I've experienced the test process while debugging a project. I took [Computer Software Design] in the third grade and [CapSTONE DESIGN I/II] in the fourth grade, and what these three have in common is that they have to select one SW they made and release the results by the end of the semester. Among them, the project I was interested in is the creation of an adventure game I did at the end of the fourth grade, and I made it in a Windows environment using Java. The content is to move to the destination avoiding enemies or traps, but since I was involved in programming myself, I couldn't help but pay attention to the operation results and bugs. At the beginning of the project, I decided what to make, then I set a detailed process and a rough time for each process, and then I started making a skeleton by drawing an operation principle (algebra). When the algorithm was completed, I coded it in Java accordingly, and executed it every time, and if there was anything wrong, I debugged it and fixed it, and then I made the final result. Then, I conducted a final test and found and corrected it if there was anything wrong. Since the debugging process itself is a time-consuming and patient task, there were times when I struggled, and even if I looked for it, I was sometimes lost in thinking about how to fix it. There were times when I tried to solve the problem with the help of my team members, but most of them proceeded by referring to the Internet or booklets. As a result, I was satisfied with obtaining A in most projects, but through a series of processes, I realized anew how important the debugging and further testing process is. Due to the influence of this subject, I have decided to apply for the job category. The QAs I know are as follows. QA is an important process in any aspect. From the company's point of view, it is the final gateway to launching a great product, so it is necessary to carefully examine and review the product from the user's point of view. Of course, it requires a lot of concentration to uncover the problem, and a logical explanation is also required to communicate and persuade the developer and the management. For this explanation, a lot of knowledge about the project is required. As mentioned in question 1, there were times when I had a hard time because debugging (which can be called part of the test process) was a work that required time and patience, and even if I looked for it, I sometimes had a hard time thinking about how to fix it. There were times when I got help from my team members, but most of them looked for answers by looking at the Internet or booklets, but I had a desire to [solve what I was assigned with my own ability], so I solved most of them by myself. And I couldn't help but be delighted in the pride I felt when I found and corrected errors over and over again. Since then, I have been more interested in the process of 'decomposing', 'fixing', and 'looking into' rather than 'making'. As I have heard the case, [The proper program did not come out because I did not get the QA properly], I realized the importance of QA and came up with the idea that 'I can do better than myself', so I applied for a test job. I am systematic. I took classes in school and recorded what I always learned in a notebook, and organized them systematically to make it easy to read again. In addition, no matter what report I write, I can write carefully to make it easier for the reader to read, but on the other hand, to make it clear what I want to say. In order to write this, I think of the content to be said, then divide it into introduction, main body, and conclusion, write a rough draft, and then go through several discharge processes to derive the result. I have a sensitivity. I have the experience of making cover art as a hobby for three years in college. At first, I was interested in design itself, so I made it for fun, but as time passed, I was able to express art in my own way, and in fact, I was able to gain recognition by receiving orders from other musicians. Although I have given up on employment activities for a while, my interest in design has not yet disappeared, so I am always willing to do it again if I have a good idea. I listen before words. Although I am not good at communicating with the other person, I have supplemented my weaknesses by quietly listening to and acknowledging them. Of course, one's argument is important, and moreover, the ability of the test job group to persuade people is necessary. I also do not stop there, and I am constantly striving by practicing my speech every day. This effort will continue even after joining the company, and I will not stop to move toward better talent."
"""Finding a way to become a SW developer through games"" I was into games when I was in high school. I played several games, including Star, FIFA, and Sudden, and was one of the top five games on campus. That's how I enjoyed playing games, so I entered the Department of Computer Engineering. After entering the Department of Computer Engineering, I was attracted to programming while taking seminars and classes. As a program developer, it was rewarding that the code I made could help users, so I decided to make it a job. In particular, I thought that the development of individual programs for various customer segments, such as PCs and mobiles, would be diversified, and accordingly, I developed my practical skills through internship and club competitions to gain expertise in program development. I learned data structure, operating system, JAVA, etc. in my undergraduate course ""solid from the foundation"" and built the foundation through algorithmic study. In addition, as an assistant professor in the 2nd and 3rd grades, I have experience in setting and managing the development environment on more than 200 computers every semester. Based on this, I gained practical experience as a mobile developer at a development company in Seocho, Seoul for six months. In addition, I was able to develop my planning, development, and collaboration skills through government tasks and competitions. I took the position of leader while working on the project ""I put cooperation with my team first."" As a leader, I put a lot of effort into harmony and synergy with my team members. When faced with technical problems, I made time to think and share the solution process every week. As a result, I realized that praise is about dancing the whale, and as a result, I received the Excellence Award at the end of the year awards and exhibitions. Even after the project was over, I was able to meet them regularly and become an indispensable colleague in college life. I worked on the project with a sense of mission to create user-friendly programs while participating as the general manager in the government task of ""user-centered development capability."" I tried to create services by reflecting customer requirements in the entire process from planning to design and development. As a result, it was an unforgettable experience to see the customer through the results. ""I take responsibility for the tasks I have been assigned to."" When I first set up a team for my graduation work, I was embarrassed because there was no server developer. I took the position of server developer with the responsibility of leading the team as a team leader. After months of wrestling with Googling and Linux books, I built servers with Linux_Apache-MySQL-PHP (LAMP) stacks and developed the Rest API to communicate with my mobile. Through my best efforts, I received favorable reviews and excellence awards at the exhibition. This experience has made me realize that doing my best in my duties is rewarding."
"I participated in the Energy Hackathon because I wanted to help many people, as the meaning of my name ""Challenge to the World"" means to be used in a big way. I created a FinTech App that provides a convenient function with the ARS function and allows me to know the power I used at home right away. As a result, I got the grand prize and found that my ideas and produced programs can be helpful in many fields. Now, the era of using IT technology not only in fintech but also in every part of our daily lives has begun. In response, Lotte Information and Communication held a ceremony marking the 20th anniversary of its foundation last year and declared a new vision to shift from IT service-oriented to business designers for sustainable growth. I think we need talented people who can challenge new visions and those who can work patiently in their duties. In that sense, I think it is suitable for the talent of Lotte Information and Communication. After joining the company, I will provide people with reliable and excellent technology for IT services and challenge emerging markets to the world. I have learned that changing ideas is important during the growth process of ""Energy Hackathon, Change of Ideas."" It was to create a fintech APP that could plan electricity use by allowing you to check the electricity usage at home in advance through energy hackathon with a smartphone. However, since a lot of fintech technologies have already been released, people around me gave negative opinions. So we thought differently and thought about whether it was convenient to use the technology from a user perspective, even though it was already made. Young people usually use smart devices well, but my grandmother and grandfather came up with something that was still difficult and uncomfortable for the blind. So, for the elderly and the visually impaired who do not use electronic devices well, we decided to add an ARS function to implement a function that can inform them of the amount they used by voice according to the current power usage. I made the Android part and had the team members make it using each API. We divided the roles and proceeded according to the limited time. As a result, more than half of smartphone users in their 30s and 60s were evaluated as being able to easily understand how much they consume in terms of money through the service, prevent indiscriminate power consumption, and prevent loss of money to individual households, and were awarded the Energy Hackathon. So, I learned that the results of my development by thinking about the customers' minds can be more efficient. In the future, I will continue to work on projects from various perspectives even after joining Lotte Information and Communication to make programs without any inconvenience. ""50, the spirit of challenge for success"" When I was in middle school, I challenged myself to learn how to ski with my friends through winter vacation. When I first dressed up and rode a lift, my eyes were just pitch black. However, as the hours and two hours went by, my skills gradually improved. Eventually, I felt like to challenge myself to a higher level course. I had fun learning and wanted to challenge myself to do it with a higher goal. However, the higher level course was not that easy. What I got was bruises and wet skiwear as I rolled down. Although I got an injury, I never gave up on going down the higher level course. After becoming a university student, I recklessly worked part-time at a ski resort shop for three months, which even a physical education student is reluctant to encounter more often. While living in a foreign country, I forgot the inconvenience in order to achieve my goal myself. During the three-month camp, I learned directly from the boss who knows skiing best, and built up basic knowledge by maintaining and managing ski equipment. As a result, a week before I finished my part-time job, when I went skiing, I challenged an advanced course and crossed the wall of the slope with an average slope of 50. Through this, I learned the importance of passion for my goal and was able to show that I was not afraid of failure. Even after joining Lotte Information and Communication, I will continue to work toward my goal without being afraid of failure. ""Challenging spirit and collaboration"" I think my strength is the spirit of challenge, and my weakness is the experience of collaboration with other fields. I learned it while preparing for a contest with my friend in college. Through the contest, I tried to make it convenient for those who use the guitar by recognizing the guitar score through video processing so that it can be easily stored and modified. To this end, I worked hard on planning and producing after school for three months with my friend. However, despite our efforts, we didn't get an award in the end. The reason is that we tried to complete it only with coding, but the image was not pretty. And I found that completing a program requires cooperation from people in various fields, not people in the SW field. Through this, I learned that my disadvantage is that I didn't have much experience in collaboration with people in other fields. A project needs the help of people in other fields, no matter how good they are. I didn't give up the challenge and found someone to help me create an image, and I finished the work by collaborating with people in other fields. As a result, I won the Samsung SW Development Competition. So what I felt was that the most important thing in a project was people. In the past, I thought it was fun to program alone. But I think it's hard to make a big project by myself. I think that working with people around me toward the same goal can make more fun and bigger results. In the future, Lotte Information and Communication will collaborate with people in other fields to overcome their shortcomings and challenge the goal of being the best. ""Global Talent"" In 10 years, the pace of IT transformation will accelerate. There must be IT professionals who can quickly acquire the latest technologies in that environment, reform groups in a more efficient direction, and respond quickly in the event of a crisis to prevent disruptions. So, when a difficult problem arises, I will become a talented person so that the name that comes to mind the most as a troubleshooter becomes my name.If I go to several conferences to become an IT expert, I will understand the current IT technology trends. And I will write the knowledge I studied every week using YouTube and blogs to remove the mind of being lazy by myself and make it a driving force to constantly run toward my goals even if I don't have a school or academy. So, I will apply amazing technologies in the IT field in many places in Lotte Information and Communication and change the color of society through IT system design and management. This is because my goal is to become a proud Lotte person who gives convenience to customers by maximizing the way I always stand in front of them and lead them."
"[Talent prepared for IoT] I entered graduate school and am conducting various research such as IoT-based smart home, analysis of sensor networks and big data, and mash-up service with situation recognition technology. It is a great joy and challenge for me to major in computer engineering that the field I am researching is the latest technology used as an actual commercial service and that it will be studied more actively in the future. In addition, I tried to gain competitiveness in my major field by developing Android apps, acquiring qualifications such as Oracle OCJP, and Cisco CCNA when I was an undergraduate. Steady efforts were able to produce high-quality results, including 3 international papers, 9 domestic papers, and 4 patent applications. It's been a long time since the term IoT was coined, but I think it has great research value as a core technology for the future industry and the problems to be solved. I want to develop with Hyundai Autoever and show my full capabilities through the learning and efforts so far. [Growth through Failure] When I took a class called Embedded Software, it was very difficult to follow from the first class and I felt very burdened with personal projects. I learned that it was a CPU governor with the advice of a senior in my lab at the time, and several tuning coverers were being provided and studied in overseas open communities to improve the strengths and weaknesses of each governor. It wasn't easy for me because I had never modified the kernel, but as it was my first project, I stayed up all night studying it. At first, I wanted to create a new coverner, but it wasn't easy, and I proceeded with the project by modifying and improving the existing open governor. Every moment was a new challenge when I was performing performance evaluations with porting a governor to an Android phone and various benchmark programs. Although I failed to develop an improved governor, I am still working on graduate research thinking about the passion of the time, such as getting to know the governor through the project and potting to an Android phone. I aim to live a planned life as much as possible. In the new year, I write plans for this year and make weekly plans at the beginning of each month. Second, I have stronger physical strength than others. I maintain my physical strength through constant exercise, and finally, I have a strong mental strength through a positive mind. This strength of me is that I will carry out my tasks with a planned and positive mind and strong physical strength in performing the tasks given after joining the company. The downside is that people around me worry a lot in advance. Perhaps it's because of the promise with me to keep the plans I've made in advance. Second, multitasking is difficult. So, when a task is given at the same time, I have to finish one task to proceed with the next task. This weakness of me is that I will try to perform tasks more planned by subdividing and step-by-step after joining the company."
"For the development of game server, I studied my major focusing on network and database. For smooth network and database programming, I took C programming, Linux system, network and data communication, and database based on my major. Based on these basic subjects, I programmed banking management in database programming, which is an application subject. In DBMS utilization and practice, we built a shopping mall using database and web programming. In addition, in Linux system programming, I learned how to manage servers using C language in the CentOS environment. The subject I was most interested in was network programming. The reason for this is that for the first time, I created an e-mail server and client called SMTP while watching an Internet English document called RFC, and there were many difficulties because I had to connect closely between the server and the client moving in the backbone only with C code rather than the application programming directly on the screen, which I have done before, so I was able to upgrade my programming skills. Based on this server development ability, I will develop a smooth game server for Netmarble's games and users. I am a Netmarble-type talent who develops good games and cooperates with my team members. When I was a freshman in college, I first encountered the world of computer software while taking C programming. I was curious to see how it appeared on the monitor using basic control statements and repetitive statements, such as obtaining a triangle area using C language and making a diamond shape. I belonged to the Internet Security Research Institute, so I started a data structure seminar using C language in the first year of college, and I enjoyed programming itself. The programming competition was perfect to maximize this fun. In order to pass the preliminary round as a team of three people, I started downloading and solving existing problems from Google. I fell in love with programming enough fun to think about the difficulty I felt for the first time and the number of colorful cases for programming, and to print and carry programming problems every class. It was a good opportunity to acquire English skills when solving additional English problems. I failed to pass the preliminary round, but I had a lot of fun using programming as an opportunity, and I am still using algorithms. The most important thing in my job, game development, is to understand the appropriate demands and development skills for customized game development. In the second semester of graduate school, we developed a safety service application for accurate vehicle communication simulation using Java programming. In order to collaborate with the Automotive Parts Research Institute, which was the main target of the application, and the laboratory that uses real vehicles at other universities, we started the development by comparing dozens of parameters and requirements. Since the main purpose of the application was an application for safety service, I studied the safety service currently being studied in advance, and studied additional proposed or modified parameters in academic societies and papers, and continued to study what is the most important point of safety service, and what companies are in the main target audience. Based on this, I used Java programming to show on the screen the location coordinates of own and other vehicles, which were values received from the network simulator, and at the same time, made additional improvements so that the vehicle's location could be seen moving together according to the moving coordinate values. ""Undergraduate project experience"" 1. 1st grade - role (individual development), responsible (C language: triangle, rock-paper-scissors, diamond, etc.) - role (follower), responsible (college student programming competition) 2. 2nd grade - role (two-person team leader), responsible (java: book management application development) 3. 3rd grade - role (four-person team leader), responsible (JDBC bank management system UML work and development general management) - role (three-person team leader), responsible (MFC poop avoidance development, Windows programming study operation, project presentation PPT writing) - role (four-person team follower), responsible (Linux system programming-CentOS utilization basic Linux utilization) - role (four-person team follower), responsible (network programming-ubutility, SMTP development using C language, modification of source code for client function, presentation PPT general) 4. 4th grade - role (four-person team follower), responsible (Android calendar memo app development, app user information management function, and overall UI function development) - role (individual development), responsible (OS Roundrobin algorithm implementation) - role (four-person team leader), responsible (four-person team leader), responsible (graduation thesis: grafting OTP onto FTP (java development - utilization of open source), OTP related trend survey and app development, FTP application implementation) - role (three-person team leader), responsible (college student programming competition)"
"""Good Dexterity Bad Boy"" I've always loved making things since I was a child. My grandmother used to hold my hand and buy me a small prefabricated robot at a stationery store in front of elementary school every day, but when I matched it, I focused on making it to the point where the day went by. Before I knew it, I had a screwdriver and a solder in my hand. It has become a hobby to disassemble and assemble broken radios, speakers, toys, etc. at home, operate by a certain principle, and find the cause of the failure. I think that the ability to concentrate and analyze from an early age is the result of finding errors in the source code or being able to sit in one place for a long time. It will help the project progress by finding errors that others cannot see and reducing the time to analyze and understand algorithms. I think that if you don't do what you're given, you'll be harmed or you'll become lazy. So my job is to try to do it to the end. When I get stuck in the middle of the work, I try to find another way to solve the problem and try not to hurt others. This has become a strength for me, so I try to keep my promise to others, and I try my best to finish what is given to me. ""The consistency of water droplets can penetrate rocks."" When I was a child, my father told me to do my job on my own. He said that if I do what is given to me, I will harm others or I will become lazy. So, I have a personality that tries to do my job until the end. When I get stuck in the middle of work, I try to find a different way to solve problems and not to hurt others. This has become my strength, so I try to keep my promise to others, and I try my best to finish what is given to me. ""If you give up, you can't dream."" When I first lived in college, I felt ashamed of myself for falling behind students who had learned in IT from high school, and after I was discharged from the military, I had a lot of fear of returning to school. However, I couldn't give up my interest in IT, so I decided to return to school, and I focused on studying so that I wouldn't fall behind other students. When I was in second grade, I created a delivery food app in the school area, and dreamed about my job as a software developer. It was a meaningful time to learn about harmony among the team members and the preparation process of the project while making a gym management program with them in the third grade. In the fourth grade, I received an overall education on Java through a security developer course based on a core structure that can be used directly from the practice implemented by the Hanbit Education Center to acquire insufficient programming knowledge, which gave me an opportunity to grow to the next level. When I first created the delivery app as a team project ""the result of interest and pride,"" it was interesting to see that students were interested. The higher the interest, the more I became attached and proud, and I decided to become a software developer. That's why I practiced by reading, coding, and coding software-related books in the library every day. With this consistency, I want to fill in the gaps and pursue a developer's path. In the book titled ""The Law of 10,000 Hours,"" he said that if you work hard for a total of 10 years for 3 hours a day, you become an expert in a field. I want to be recognized as an expert and become a developer who is helpful to someone."
"[Life of Communication] I have grown through communication since I was in elementary school. When I was in the fourth grade of elementary school, I was the president and told my teachers about my friends' suggestions and complaints. My teacher took appropriate measures accordingly, and I was able to create a good atmosphere in my class. Based on this, I was able to further improve my communication skills while serving as the president in the fifth and sixth grades. I worked in a tennis club in college. As the 'leadership manager' who plans training, I discussed training methods with my club members through weekly meetings. Through this, I was able to increase my teamwork and achieved the quarterfinals for the first time ever in a national competition involving 128 university teams. Through this experience, I believe that the definition of communication is 'achievement'. It is because good results have always followed good communication. My goal is to live a life of communication with others. After joining the company, I will show good results through internal communication with my customers and colleagues. [Dreaming Developer] I made the following efforts to become a developer in the IT field. First, I took courses in C, C++, Java, Android, Python, and Verilog. Through this, I was able to learn various languages and learn the differences between languages. Second, I learned the basics and skills of programming through the subject of data structure and algorithms. Through this, I was able to learn how to design with an emphasis on optimization and efficiency. Third, I was able to learn about Linux systems through system programming, operating system, and embedded computing. I worked on a project based on these Linux systems. I controlled the Linux kernel and device driver through 'unmanned parking' using Raspberry Pi, 'smart home for working mothers', and a project using a real router. Finally, I worked as an intern in the graduate lab for a year. Through various Linux systems and LVS, I was able to experience the overall network using Linux systems. The criteria for selecting a [customer-oriented pioneer] company is to prioritize whether it matches the company's direction. The Hyundai Department Store Group is aiming at 'the company most trusted by customers'. As a developer, my value is 'to make convenient products'. I think these points are consistent with each other in terms of 'customer orientation'. I applied because I wanted to make products for customers based on synergy. In 2015, I proceeded with the project by using EV3 car robots. Since I use car robots, I started looking for topics that can provide convenience to drivers. He is always good at driving, but I remembered his mother calling his father because of parking in front of his house, so I selected the theme as ""unmanned parking."" First, parking lines were detected through video processing using a camera. It is composed of a system that automatically parks by controlling the wheel motor according to the location of the detected line. I think this experience will help Hyundai Green Food make products for customers. [Please Take Care of My Working Mom] I think that the advantage that differentiates me from others is 'executive power'. After joining the company, I will take the initiative in my work based on my execution power. In 2013, I had a part-time job at a middle school entrance examination institute. The phone calls to the academy were mainly from working mothers asking if the student arrived at the academy safely. Through this, we came up with an idea from areas concerned about the safety of the students and produced the 'Smart Home for Working Mom' project. First, we made smart home devices such as Gab Valve and Interphone. We created a smartphone app so that the mother at work can control these smart home devices. Based on this, we have constructed a system that can keep the safety of a child alone at home. Based on this experience, Hyundai Green Food will first identify the needs of customers. Based on our execution ability, we will meet our customers' needs and solve their problems. Through this, we will make our customers happy and take the lead in achieving Vision 2020."
"[Life of Communication] I have grown by 'communicating' since I was in elementary school. When I was the 4th grade, I was the chairman and told my teachers about my friends' suggestions and complaints. The teacher took appropriate measures accordingly, and I was able to lead a good atmosphere in the class. In addition, I further improved my communication skills by serving as the chairman in the 5th and 6th grades. I participated in the 2015 contest and showed my communication skills. The team members had difficulty choosing a topic because they were interested in different fields due to different majors. To solve the difficulties, I listened to the team members. Rather than deciding alone as a leader, I could come up with more ideas while listening to the team members' opinions. Through this process, I was able to decide on the topic of 'HVDC'. Several majors came together to approach the topic from various perspectives, prepare a practical and objective story, and passed the document screening process through the competition ratio of 22:1. I think the definition of communication is 'two-way traffic'. I made good results because of the good free speech and listening among the team members. After joining the company, I will show good results through stories from colleagues, related technology companies, and customers. I had the experience of solving the concerns of working mothers and leading up to the award. I applied in line with KCC's direction of putting customers first. When I worked part-time at the cram school, my main task was to answer the phone to see if the students arrived at the academy safely. Through this, I was able to understand the practical concerns of working mothers, and it was an opportunity to develop a 'Smart Home for Working Moms' project that could keep the safety of a child who is alone at home. First, we organized various smart home devices. We created a smartphone app to control these smart home devices with a smartphone. Implementing the function optimized for working mothers, I won the Excellence Award at the Embedded SW Competition and the Presidential Award at the School Graduation Work Competition. KCC has recently been pursuing to improve customer service through preparing a mobile network environment and VR showrooms. In addition, it also meets the needs of customers through smart glass and smart flooring. I think the experience of solving working mothers' concerns is consistent with KCC's customer orientation. After joining the company, we will make all KCC products smart and give customers convenience. I think the role of the computerized job is to solve the inconvenience of users in the computer system. I have experience in developing an 'unmanned parking' system to solve the inconvenience of novice drivers. In the embedded computing system subject, a project was carried out using an EV3 car robot. He is always good at driving, but I remembered his mother calling his father because of parking in the parking lot, so I chose 'unmanned parking'. First, I detected the parking line using a camera. Based on the location and number of detected parking lines, we implemented a system that allows automatic parking by controlling the direction of the wheel motor. In addition, we added a convenient function. I installed LEDs next to wheels because I had difficulty parking when parking at dark night because I couldn't see wheels. We created a convenient parking environment by implementing the LEDs to turn on automatically in dark situations. I got A+ credit and user-oriented importance from the professor's high praise for placing importance on user convenience. I think the main customer of KCC computer system is the 'employee'. After joining the company, I will become a new employee who listens to the inconvenience of the employees and improves them. I think I am suitable for those who are honest with their customers and organizations, and have a sense of duty and responsibility. I have experience in making good results by faithfully serving as a coach. During the years when I was working in a tennis club, I did not have good results in national competitions. As a coach planning training, I thought that the reason why I did not have good results was a problem with the training method. I had a weekly meeting with my team members to set my goal of making it to the finals, and through the feedback, I changed my training method as follows. First, it was 'practical experience.' Some of the team members were freshmen who had never played actual games. Therefore, they played actual games with various opponents as part of the training. By inspiring interest in tennis, I developed a sense of practice. Second, it is 'eye-level education.' We conducted the survey by asking each team member about their shortcomings one by one. Unlike the past when all the team members used the same training method, the training method was divided by level to fill in the gaps. As a result, my skills improved by supplementing my shortcomings, and advanced to the quarterfinals for the first time ever in a competition involving 128 teams."
"[3 driving forces] I had a very eventful growth process due to my family background, which was three sisters when I was young and four siblings when I was young, and my father's special job. I had a lot of family members, so if I didn't do what was given to me, it was a mess. It was a complicated process where I often acted as I wanted because it was difficult for my parents to focus on one person. It influenced a lot in the formation of my personality. It developed a sense of responsibility for a given task, drive for what I wanted to do, and leadership as a leader. During my school life, I was in charge of the most group projects, and I was able to finish all the projects first, especially by playing a leading role in the deepening coding classes in the C++ programming class. In addition, I have developed into a professional level after numerous failures and successes in order to solve the big homework of presentation that I had given to me when I entered college. When I was in the role of accounting in the club, I participated in all meetings and events sincerely, and I have a habit of checking carefully to avoid any problems, especially in the financial aspects necessary to successfully carry out the event. Responsibility, drive, and leadership are the driving forces that I try to do my best in any organization I belong to. When I join IDIS, I will work hard as a driving force based on these three principles in the organization that is given to me. [2D] My tenet is 2D. 2D is Dedicate and Develop, which means to develop by yourself no matter which organization you belong to and in any environment you are in. Since I was young, I have devoted myself to reading books or attending computer classes after school in order to develop various abilities, and I have always served with the mindset of serving in both classes and clubs. In situations of need, I have always provided what I have when I need it. I have helped in a variety of ways, from small to big, and as a result, I have been nicknamed ""out of the blue."" It means that I fill in what I really need when I need it. When a need arises in IDIS, I will come forward according to the tenets and become the employee who fills in the need. [21st Century Candy] I grew up the third of four siblings in a not very wealthy family environment. There were many trees on the tree that had no good wind days, so we did, and this is why I have a candy-like personality that swallows my negative emotions and gives off positive energy. In a university that requires group activities, such as an undergraduate or club, my positive and bright personality has been able to win favor from people and resolve conflicts, big and small, without difficulty. This will have a positive effect on the organization as well as an employee who can lead a bright atmosphere. However, sometimes the positive can be poisonous. When I was young, I didn't study during exams, saying that I could study later, and when I was just entering college, I put off doing what I had to do. However, recognizing that these habits were wrong, I tried to do what I had to do in order to correct them without putting off writing down on my smartphone wallpaper or purchasing a small scheduler. As a result, I have no delay in what I have to do, and I have been able to sort out big and small things, organize them well and handle them efficiently. Candy sometimes shows a bad attitude toward delaying what I have to do. However, I am always determined and striving to open the scheduler. [Design-aware developer] Development and design are very different, so there are many cases where they don't understand their areas. However, as a design-aware developer, I can act as a bridge to consider design from the development stage. If it takes 100 hours to become a great software program and a great design program at the same time, I can shorten the time by 30 hours in my role. When I was working on a team project based on language C Tetris in the algorithm class, I was able to develop a design program unlike other teams. I didn't have enough time because I tried to add design elements to the programs that were already made, except for a few teams, and I couldn't take this into account, but my team was able to successfully complete the project on time because we created a program that considered design from the beginning. The project results were well received and are currently being used as teaching materials. As a developer who knows how to eliminate the possible discord and develop software more efficiently, I would like to create an integrated security solution at IDIS. [mission and vision, together] The first thing I learned in the second half of 2016 was mission and vision in the class called 'Startup and Technology Management'. I was taught that mission is the ultimate value and reason for existence of a company, and vision is a short-term goal for misson. In addition, I was taught that a company with mission and vision does not collapse easily and can succeed in every way, which is why I applied for IDIS. IDIS' mission is 'contributing to making a safer and happier world through creation and innovation'. With my creed of 2D, I want to contribute to making a happy world by demonstrating my role as a floating gold medalist at IDIS. My future ambition is to continue working for a company for a long time and grow with that company. As a member of the club I served as an accountant, I worked hard in everything, believing that even if what I did in the club was nothing more than a small flap, it would be like a big storm in the future. Having spent four years in a club together, I learned that it is better to change where I belong than to find a place that suits my taste.Even if the results are insignificant, my goal is to do my best where I belong and be with you. If I join IDIS, I want to work to become a company that provides the best solutions in the world, which is IDIS's current vision, and to further achieve my mission. My special strength is communication and solid basic skills. In the first semester of my fourth year, I developed Bookbeol, an application for lending and selling books, as a graduation project. I organized the home screen with Tab, which I used to use comfortably, but I suffered from errors due to the difficulty of Tab, which had slightly different composition depending on the compatibility of the textbook and Android Studio version and its use. In fact, since it was a graduation project, the fact that it was carried out rather than implementation was enough, but our team worked hard together to solve the problem through discussions, and eventually changed to Button, not Tab, and developed it. As a team member, I was able to develop my communication skills, as I helped the team leader and took the role of a clerk to facilitate the progress of the team project. The most important thing in my major is the solid foundation. Practical experience and experience are important, but I thought I needed to lay the foundation well because I needed to actually start working on what kind of tasks I would perform, and I prepared a lot. First of all, I took classes in subjects such as C, JAVA, C++, and algorithm with a sincere attitude, and as a result, I was able to achieve good grades. In addition, I participated in the C language competition and JAVA competition held on campus, and received an encouragement award at the C language competition. I also studied the information processing technician certificate, which is considered essential in my related major, and have passed the written test, and am currently conducting a practical test, and I am expected to pass the result of additional grading. I have put a lot of effort into such a solid foundation, which will be the cornerstone for me to learn a sincere attitude and work well even after joining IDIS."
"""Life of Communication"" Since elementary school, I have grown by communicating. When I was in the fourth grade of elementary school, I was the president and told my teachers about my friends' suggestions and complaints. My teacher took appropriate measures accordingly, and I was able to create a good atmosphere in my class. Based on this, I was able to further improve my communication skills while serving as the president in the fifth and sixth grades. I worked in a tennis club in college. As the 'leadership manager' who plans training, I discussed training methods with my club members through weekly meetings. Through this, my teamwork was able to increase, and I was able to achieve the quarterfinals for the first time ever in a national competition involving 128 university teams. Through this experience, I believe that the definition of communication is 'achievement'. It is because good results have always followed good communication. My goal is to live a life of communication with others. I think this communication ability is useful when I work in cooperation with other departments and team members. I think it will be helpful to communicate smoothly and exchange opinions efficiently. I felt the importance of readability after reading the books, ""Readability through 'Because it hurts' to be youth'"" and ""It hurts to be youth."" Among the books I read recently, the most memorable one is 'It's because I'm in pain. I don't have a habit of reading books, so it takes me a long time to understand if it contains even a little difficult content. However, Nan-do Kim easily solved the story, so it was easy to understand because it was good to read. Based on this experience, I thought readability was important for program developers. I learned the lesson that I have to implement the code readably because the code is shared by many people, not alone. The advantage of being a "" meticulous tree that gives without hesitation"" personality is that it takes care of others. I like to remember conversations with others in detail and give them anniversaries, favorite foods, etc. because I have a good memory. It is because I feel good when I see the other person's favorite appearance. In this way, my nickname has become ""the tree that gives freely"" among seniors, juniors, and colleagues. Through this, I will listen to the opinions of customers through communication with customers in the future. I will become a generous tree that creates and provides the services that customers want based on listening. The disadvantage of my personality is that I am meticulous and slow in processing things. When I work normally, I tend to be unsatisfied if I don't do it perfectly. In order to overcome these shortcomings, I prioritize my work and proceed with what I can do quickly. Now that I'm very familiar with it, I'm taking turns doing my work by prioritizing it according to the deadline. I think that these shortcomings will be delayed when developing them according to a tight schedule. After joining the company, I will save the strengths, compensate for the shortcomings, and demonstrate my abilities. ""Please Take Care of a Working Mom"" As I was interested in IoT, I conducted ""Smart Home for Working Mom"" as a graduation work. I think it can be used in Timon as a result of my interest in execution and technology. In 2013, I had a part-time job at a middle school entrance examination institute for six months. The calls to the academy were mainly from mothers who worked asking if the student arrived at the academy safely. Through this, I got an idea from the part concerned about the safety of the students and planned a ""Smart Home for Working Mom"" project. We produced ""Smart Home for Working Mom"" with the following system. First, we have constructed smart home devices for the safety of children. We have configured 'gas valve' using a servo motor, 'interphone' using a switch sensor, and 'air conditioner' control that shows temperature using an LCD. We also created 'Please Take Care of a Working Mom' smartphone application so that a mother at work can control these smart home devices with a smartphone. Based on this, we were able to implement a system that could keep the safety of a child who is alone at home. Second, we have configured it to do housework. This is because working mothers are interested in not only the safety of their children but also housework. To this end, we have configured smart home devices that check the inside of a refrigerator using a magnetic sensor, feed pets using a servo motor, and control fluorescent lights in the house based on LEDs. We have implemented a system that allows people to blend housework together. Smartphones and smart home devices are linked together so that they can be controlled with a smartphone. Based on this, we were able to highlight the role of working mothers who can pay attention to housework together. Third, we added robots in the house. It has been configured to control the robot with a smartphone when there is a place to check everywhere in the house. In addition, by attaching a beacon to the robot, a differentiating element has been added so that the current location can be identified on the smartphone. Based on the execution power, it has been implemented focusing on convenience and safety according to the needs of customers. Based on this experience, I think it will be helpful in various fields such as creating applications, building web servers, and implementing services that customers need. Through this, after joining the company, we will first identify the needs of customers at Tmon. Based on execution power, we will meet the needs of customers and solve customers' problems. Through this, we will become new employees who take the lead in performing tasks by adding differentiating factors. I think the moment when we set and achieved the goal of ""developing an unmanned parking system using EV3"" was the most meaningful. After joining the company, I will overcome difficulties through problem solving skills. In 2015, I carried out a project using Raspberry Pi and EV3 automobile robots. The value as a developer is 'to make convenient products'. He drives well, but I remembered his mother calling his father because of parking in front of his house, so I chose the theme as 'unmanned parking'. Based on this, we set the goal to link the 'unmanned parking' system by implementing the function of the actual car. I organized the project in the following way. During programming, I experienced the following challenges. First, attaching five cameras to give me a parking field of view was a choice that overlooked the performance of the hardware.""Life of Communication"" Since elementary school, I have grown by communicating. When I was in the fourth grade of elementary school, I was the president and told my teachers about my friends' suggestions and complaints. My teacher took appropriate measures accordingly, and I was able to create a good atmosphere in my class. Based on this, I was able to further improve my communication skills while serving as the president in the fifth and sixth grades. I worked in a tennis club in college. As the 'leadership manager' who plans training, I discussed training methods with my club members through weekly meetings. Through this, my teamwork was able to increase, and I was able to achieve the quarterfinals for the first time ever in a national competition involving 128 university teams. Through this experience, I believe that the definition of communication is 'achievement'. It is because good results have always followed good communication. My goal is to live a life of communication with others. I think this communication ability is useful when I work in cooperation with other departments and team members. I think it will be helpful to communicate smoothly and exchange opinions efficiently. I felt the importance of readability after reading the books, ""Readability through 'Because it hurts' to be youth'"" and ""It hurts to be youth."" Among the books I read recently, the most memorable one is 'It's because I'm in pain. I don't have a habit of reading books, so it takes me a long time to understand if it contains even a little difficult content. However, Nan-do Kim easily solved the story, so it was easy to understand because it was good to read. Based on this experience, I thought readability was important for program developers. I learned the lesson that I have to implement the code readably because the code is shared by many people, not alone. The advantage of being a "" meticulous tree that gives without hesitation"" personality is that it takes care of others. I like to remember conversations with others in detail and give them anniversaries, favorite foods, etc. because I have a good memory. It is because I feel good when I see the other person's favorite appearance. In this way, my nickname has become ""the tree that gives freely"" among seniors, juniors, and colleagues. Through this, I will listen to the opinions of customers through communication with customers in the future. I will become a generous tree that creates and provides the services that customers want based on listening. The disadvantage of my personality is that I am meticulous and slow in processing things. When I work normally, I tend to be unsatisfied if I don't do it perfectly. In order to overcome these shortcomings, I prioritize my work and proceed with what I can do quickly. Now that I'm very familiar with it, I'm taking turns doing my work by prioritizing it according to the deadline.

"In my life, I am living with the motto of 'careful and like'. Being passionate about something and liking it is because I believe that not only developing insight into a field, but also a lot of experience I have in the process will help me develop myself. Therefore, I am living with the importance of being deeply engaged in whatever I do and making my own. This value has become the advantage of digging deeper into the field of interest than anyone else and bringing it out into competence. When a friend asked me to create a homepage in the past, I focused all day long, relearned the skills, completed it one by one, and succeeded in producing satisfactory results. In addition, knowing one field has developed the ability to know about other fields and think from more diverse perspectives, which has also been my strength. My weakness is that sometimes my level of enthusiasm is a little overheated, so I don't respond even if someone calls me, or I starve to death all day and do something in one thing. In order to overcome these shortcomings, I also flexibly set the schedule adjustment so that I do not get too immersed in it, so that I can distribute the weight of other tasks evenly. I want to spread Korean literature contents through digital methods and make people from all over the world interested in Korean literature. It was a pity that Korean cultural contents succeeded in enhancing the status of overseas, centering on K-POP, but there were relatively few cases where literary works such as poetry and novels were known. I believe that Korean literature will be more recognized in the world if it can be introduced in a wider variety of ways through video production or graphics. As I have been exposed to computers since I was young, I realized that the delivery of computer contents, especially through networks, will become important in the future society. The homepage, one of the means to exchange contents on the Internet, was created and released for the first time when I was in the fifth grade of elementary school. With this experience as an opportunity, I started to deal with graphic production tools such as Photoshop and Flash, and produced graphic images, banners, and simple animations. By the time I was a high school student, YouTube had appeared to deal with programs that produced and edited videos, believing that the way contents were delivered would change, centering on videos. This experience was a great help in producing product pages and banners when I became a college student while working part-time at an Internet shopping mall, and it was also a driving force in producing and releasing videos used for school events when I was affiliated with a university broadcasting station. My dream is to further develop the content culture in Korea so that everyone, including myself, can lead a better cultural life. In order to achieve that dream, I drew my way by thinking about the content market in five years, 10 years, and beyond. Five years later: Even though great contents have been produced, I cannot afford to distribute or promote them, so I contribute to promoting the contents to everyone by assisting in promotional activities. Ten years later: cultural contents such as Korean literature and cartoons are now widely known overseas. However, for long-term success overseas, more diverse genres of contents should be known and shown to many people. Based on my experience at the Korea Literature Translation Institute, I have produced and promoted videos that promote various works. Since then: In order to go further as a content powerhouse, it is necessary to continuously develop and discover content. I am planning a start-up that can help with content production, drawing up countless ideas that have not been expressed, and through this, I can produce more advanced content."
"First, a talented person who quickly adapts to the environment, grows and leads innovation. I have worked on various projects and have experienced various languages, platforms, development environments, methodologies, and productivity-related tools. So, I am not afraid to develop in a new environment. No matter what mission is assigned, I will become a talented person who quickly adapts and produces results. Second, a person who teaches me what I have learned again will be short-lived, but Korea's S/W industry will continue. After joining the company, I will pass on the learned knowledge to my juniors, so that Hankom will contribute to sustainable growth. Through the above two values, I will grow with the company and pass on what I have learned to the next generation, contribute to the continuous development of Korean language and computers, and further strengthen the competitiveness of Korea's S/W industry, and my ultimate dream is to become an S/W powerhouse. Rather than being satisfied with my assignments and good grades at school, I tried to become a 'real developer' through various project experiences. 1 Group-based schedule synchronization Android app (5 months) 2 700 people Intranet development and operation (13 months) 3 Interactive promotion site (4 months) 4 NOSQL web dashboard (3 months) 5 O2O website related to home sharing (6 months) 6 ACM ICPC algorithm competition (2013-2015, 3 years) I wanted to erase the feeling of a student from me until today, when I started developing it. I made the above efforts to acquire the mindset and skills of an expert. As a result, I was able to design programs from the user's point of view, take the initiative in projects, and become a talented person who can fulfill my role. Now, I really want to get away from being a student and become a developer of Hangul and computers. I have the following tenets. First, I tried to experience many fields. When I was a short undergraduate, I tried to become a person with strong background knowledge in the overall IT field by experiencing various fields rather than digging deep into one field. Second, I thought basic studies such as algorithms, design patterns, and networks were important. This is because I thought basic studies were factors that were directly connected to performance, such as memory issues. Finally, I wanted to become a developer who can collaborate with colleagues. I don't think there is a developer who can make a program alone. Therefore, I think the ability to communicate with team members and to proceed with projects systematically is just as important as development ability. Based on this, Hancom will fully demonstrate my abilities and contribute to the development of proud domestic offices."
"When I first learned about computers, I was interested in the relationship between S/W and the people who use them. Therefore, I mainly worked on projects that were close to people, such as an intranet that easily stores and helps members manage their information, promotional sites that entertain users' eyes with dynamic effects, and websites that support home sharing procedures. As a result, I realized that the people who use them in S/W development are really important. That's why I thought of Lotte. Lotte's mission is to contribute to the prosperous life of mankind by providing products and services that are loved and trusted. I thought that there must be a part that I can contribute as a developer to Lotte's efforts to contribute to the prosperous life of people in various fields. Lotte, the company closest to people, will grow up with the company with the dream of providing better services based on my S/W capabilities. 'To become a competent developer, not a good student!' I wanted to become a developer based on theories rather than a student who does assignments well and receives good grades in school. So I always thought about what I should do to achieve my desired goal, rather than passively taking classes and doing assignments. As a result, I ran toward my dream through two years of S/W specialized training, experience in various projects ranging from 3 to 4 months, and challenge for 3 consecutive years in the OO college programming competition. From the 2nd grade when I started development to the present day, I wanted to erase the feeling of a student from me, and I tried to have various experiences to acquire the mindset and skills of a professional. As a result, I was able to design programs from the user's point of view, take the initiative in participating in projects, and become a talented person who can fulfill my role. Now, I will truly escape from being a student and continue my growth at Lotte. The membership of the ""oo company S/W membership network division manager, who wanted to be of strength to the membership"" has three division managers, each of software, hardware, and network. Before members started their assignments, they gave technical advice on their field, participated in the opening and interim presentations with the membership manager to evaluate them, and also participated in interviews for new employees. Among them, I was selected as the head of the network division. I thought that I should be helpful to the organization called membership, so I studied the basics day and night and tried to become a branch manager that would be helpful to the members. On the day of the assignment meeting, I looked at the documents written by the members a day earlier and wondered if there was anything to study and give them any advice. And in order to ask logical and objective questions during the assignment evaluation or new interview, I prepared twice as much as the usual meeting. As a result, I gained the trust of the members as I was recognized as a sub-chairman who can share and think about solutions no matter what problems arise. It was the result of thinking that the members' assignments were my assignments, and they were interested in me, and helped me a lot. Although it was difficult for me, it was a great opportunity to naturally study various fields, which helped me a lot in the long run. When I passed on to the next sub-chairman after my term in office, there was a lot different from the beginning. I have developed knowledge, self-management skills, and above all, 34 strong motives in the IT field. Now, I want to fully show my capabilities in a new organization called Lotte. 'This is one of the two things I have been solving now that I have died!` When I was on the intranet team, I used to say this as a half-joking joke when my coworkers asked me if I wasn't going to bed. As such, I have the strength to do my best to solve an issue that arises during the project process. I came to have the above character because I enjoyed the series of processes of trying this or that various methods and eventually finding the cause of the problem and solving it. Rather than simply a one-dimensional solution to the problem, I tried to track and solve the issues that were slightly suspicious or open to improvement. I used to forget about sleeping until late at night and engage in problems one by one, analyzing sources line by line, or asking for help from references or communities. As a result, I was able to develop a broader and stronger foundation and ability to cope with exceptions. Those experiences have come together and have greatly influenced my belief that any problem can be solved with perseverance and effort. Even today, that idea remains unchanged, and I am confident that I will overcome any problem with my passion and perseverance. However, I couldn't afford to do other hobbies due to my immersion in the IT field. I liked extreme sports, but I often skipped thinking, 'I'm going to do it next time after doing everything I'm busy now.' So, these days, I'm not only developing it, but I'm trying to live a leisurely life with occasional hobbies. 'It provides new user experiences with more personalized services.' I will analyze customer information and Lotte's service usage history at Lotte and recommend services that customers may need to provide new user experiences. Today, with the development of big data and artificial intelligence technology, computers are gradually understanding people. Accordingly, in the past, if the service used by all customers was simply ranked and provided to users, now it is necessary to analyze the customer's service usage tendency and pattern and provide 'service only for that customer' accordingly. Therefore, I would like to do a job of analyzing and providing services suitable for users at Lotte based on my S/W technology. By providing Lotte's service to customers, we will contribute to becoming a more trusted Lotte by the people by providing differentiated user experience."
"[Challenging attitude that transcends limits] I don't think it's difficult to develop my potential skills anymore. It bothered me that I didn't achieve anything before joining the military. Meanwhile, I saw a competition for entrepreneurship on campus, and I decided to take on a new challenge and put it into action immediately. With my colleagues and I, we planned a device called a mobile application vending machine in consideration of the release of smartphones. The idea was to install devices that help transmit content using Bluetooth at stations and stations at the time, given that it was not easy to access content on public transportation due to the low penetration rate of smartphones. However, due to the end-of-semester exams in the middle of the semester, the spirit of the beginning disappeared, and I also wanted to give up and focus on other studies, but it was a waste of work that I had been doing so far, and it was a shame that I gave up in the middle. The members of the group agreed with this. Also, because I was the one who attracted everyone, I was able to motivate them again and apply in a short period of time by working late at school even after the exam. As a result, I was able to develop into a person who not only won statues and prize money, but also actively participated in new challenges since then. I want to become a person who leads by actively participating in new challenges such as building a promising IoT network at SK Telecom. [A future where actions that no one has done, not ideas, change] I even got a reward for solving the problem with constant analysis and extraordinary tenacity. When I was in the military, my cleaning area was in charge of a public bathhouse. It was an arduous area where cleaning was repeated every night and the sewage that flows backward was called every night. When I observed the public bathhouse all day to find out the cause of the continuous clogged sewer, it was the sand falling from the indoor shoes I wore when I took the bath. As a result, I advised the company members to come in barefoot when entering the public bathhouse, but few people obeyed the request. As another solution, I set up a sentry to point out during the bath time, but it was too inefficient, and I went back to the drawing board. When I was in trouble again, I analyzed the cause of wearing slippers and found that there was no clear boundary between the hallway and the bathhouse, so I was able to enter and exit without hesitation. So, when I used bricks to separate the shoe removal area at the entrance of the bathhouse, I naturally took off my slippers and went in, so I couldn't find grains of sand in the bathhouse. After that, the administrative supply officer saw this and ordered me to run errands like this, and as a reward, I even got a night out. I felt that if I analyzed it with grit rather than dissatisfaction when I encountered a problem, the result could be that things that no one had thought of could be discarded. [Depending on intelligence makes whales dance] Rather than ignoring it because it is different from me, I chose to make a small sacrifice. During the second grade curriculum, I was assigned to create a game that was easily manipulated using Microsoft Visual Studio in groups of two in a subject called ""Application Design"". I formed a group with a friend who was normally like-minded, and through a compromise, I planned a game to find points in a maze. However, when I started making the game, I started to get into trouble. While I had planned to create prototypes based on what I learned in class, I kept revising and adding them, but my friend ignored the process, saying it would be a waste of time to do so. However, I gradually started programming, and whenever I was finished one by one, I went to my friend and asked him for his results and opinions. He first pressed me, asking why I did that, but as the saying goes, if you have an intellect, you should be grateful. Perhaps if you tried to complete it by yourself or thought it was unfair to do it by yourself, you would not have achieved satisfactory results within the period. After that, the game was executed without difficulty on the day of the presentation, and I could see the satisfied professor's expression. Since then, I have felt that everyone gets satisfactory results if they sacrifice themselves, as well as blame others in conflict with the other person. [Realizing the beauty of engineering] The time I took to learn the beauty of engineering from my uncle, who was an engineering student, paved the way for me. I often worked part-time in my uncle's factory. I learned step by step from processing to assembling. One day, I was organizing electric wiring, and my uncle showed me how to organize the wiring, saying, 'Engineering is a job that pursues beauty'. He said that it is not only good to look neat, but it can also reduce working hours to solve problems in the future. Since then, I have been more touched by the messy wiring in other factories. I gained a lot from that experience. Due to the nature of my major, I had a lot of circuit experiments and programming practice. When I debugging the source I programmed during the practice, when a large amount of bugs occurred, my eyes were dark. Every time, I started to develop a habit of organizing things one by one, recalling my uncle's lessons. I spared no effort until the moment I saw it and felt neat and beautiful. Since then, no matter what kind of bug occurred, and no matter how much the circuit I configured did not work, I have achieved the result of seeing the neat structure and solving it in a short time. I came to think that not only artists but also engineers should pursue rational beauty. In the future, even when dealing with tasks given to me in my job, I think that if I deal with them based on those lessons, I can do things more efficiently than anyone else. [Embedded system education that is more valuable than scholarships] We have a chance to take a step closer to the IoT industry, which is impossible to beat in our lives in the future. I had an opportunity to learn the Embedded System using ATmega 128 through a subject called a third-grade microprocessor. At that time, I burned my enthusiasm for learning after seeing an article on the Internet that a foreign elementary school student made and sold multifunctional digital watches that he programmed. In fact, the theory class was boring.However, when I entered the program without understanding the exact theory, I could not neglect the theory class because I saw that the bug did not add up. In addition, after learning that Embedded System is an essential part of everyday devices in the future, I wanted to know more details and accurately than others. The contents of the class ranged from turning on the LED to making a digital watch that a little kid did. However, I was unfamiliar with the C language, and the professor seemed tired from the constant questions. However, I completed the watch with a clear belief, and as a result, I participated in the on-campus capstone design contest with the recommendation of the professor. While preparing for the PPT to present the project design process and results I did in the lecture, it was easy to understand the Embedded System, and the structural understanding of ATmega 128 became clearer. Luckily, I was able to get a scholarship through an on-campus contest"
"The first project undertaken by the ou software membership was 'Kimchinity', which can be simultaneously developed using a server, and a game development tool made of WPF is used to create and execute games on the web. It was the first project of my membership, and I was so happy to make my own Tzukur game that I only enjoyed, that I decided to complete it. However, due to the lack of preliminary research, there were many difficulties in implementing it, and since all the team members were in charge of developing the genre for the first time, there were problems in acquiring skills. The morale of the team members was not even the beginning, and there were many talks about quitting. However, I wanted to complete the first project somehow, and I didn't want to miss the opportunity to develop development tools. So, even communication disappeared, and I talked to them constantly, and sometimes gathered to relieve the atmosphere by watching alcohol, games, and movies, even if it was not a development meeting. I was motivated to start over with a slightly improved atmosphere, and I threw away the parts to be thrown away and developed or induced them to slightly open the direction. As a result, I completed it somehow at a fixed time. Of course, the result was a very different form from what I thought in the beginning, but I was proud of the relief that I finished it safely. In addition, it was an experience where I realized the importance of preliminary research and communication between team members once again. My first project is games. I formed a team to participate in an on-campus software competition and developed a sports arcade game using MFCs that I was learning at school. At the time of development, I was overwhelmed with game knowledge through a lot of gameplay, but I was frustrated because I was not able to implement those functions. Fortunately, I had a colleague on the team who had some experience, so I learned the basic concept of development with the help of that friend. The second project is also a game, but this time I developed an online action RPG by adding a network function. I have a low understanding of the socket, and I used only one thread, so the server burst frequently. I wanted to develop the server side together, but I didn't have enough time, so I took on the client part. I learned about class design, character movement, and events that I felt was lacking in previous projects. The third project created a game development tool. By developing offline tools first, online for the second time, and production tools for the last time, we gradually expanded our scope of development. While working on the development tool, I had a great difficulty in handling events. There were so many constraints that I did not create a compiler, but ended up using events set by developers rather than allowing users to create various events. While working on the three projects, I felt a lot of shortcomings, and I applied for an NCsoft internship because I wanted to improve myself. First, I want to be the person I need in the team. As I worked on several projects, I felt it was important to complete my part. I want to do my job properly, and if I can afford it, I want to help other team members and become an indispensable person in the team. After that, if I have the opportunity, I want to realize the game I've only imagined in my head while playing the game for the rest of my life, develop my game, and achieve my dream of enjoying it. Even if I don't have a chance to make a new game, I want to put the game of the team I'm in to the top position."
"[KT thinks of customers] The first reason I came to like KT was because of its Wi-Fi. Looking at Oleh Wifi, which is easy to see anywhere in the country, I could feel how much KT thinks of customers. The ideal company for me is a place where I have the ability to think of customers first and provide them with convenience. The only place that fits my ideal was KT. Based on my knowledge of communication major for customers, I want to continue constant communication in the network control/operation team. I have one year of experience as a data input/inspection intern at 'oooooo'. Thanks to my experience at that time, I am confident in detecting and correcting errors. My motivation for supporting KT's network operation/control was to reduce errors one by one for customers and to reduce the inconvenience to zero for customers. [Steady Study] After joining the company, I will continue to study network for the development of KT and I. Since technological advancement evolves faster and faster day by day, I think it is essential to make efforts to provide better services to customers. I will not stay at the current level even after time passes, and in 10 years, I will try to acquire as much knowledge as 10 years from now on. Through this, the goal is to obtain a license for a telecommunications driver in the mid- to long-term, including an information technician, and ultimately to reduce customer discomfort/complaints to zero. [Firm from the basics] I participated in the 'oooooo' club, which is building a house of love, and went to build a house in Yangpyeong from August 23 to 24, 2011. Since it is a house-building club, many of the members of the club majored in architecture. I thought that safety education and wearing safety equipment were essential because it is a construction site that builds a house. However, most of the other club members were insensitive to safety because they thought it was a familiar job, and they did not sincerely try to complete it. Since the construction site is a place that could be dangerous for life, I suggested the 'Safety Education Team' to the president of the club, and I took over as the team leader. Before starting work twice a day in the morning/lunch, I conducted simple stretching, checked wearing safety equipment such as safety helmets, and conducted safety training for safety so that the club members were put into work. Eventually, all club members received safety training, wore safety equipment, started building houses, and were able to return to school safely after completing their volunteer work. No matter how well the house was built, its meaning would have been greatly diluted if someone had been injured. Looking at the members of the architecture club who were insensitive to the safety of the time, I could feel that it was difficult to keep the basics as I got used to it. Just as the first floor needs to be strong so that the second floor does not collapse, as an intern at KT, I will become an intern who prepares and implements the basics firmly. [With my gums] I worked as an administrative soldier when I served in the military, and when I had a communication problem in the office, I asked for help from the communications unit. One day, the TV in the commander's office was cut off from the signal, so I contacted the communications unit, but it did not work out after a long time. In the office, other executives were urging me to resolve the commander's TV, and the communications unit was unable to identify the cause of the problem. As an administrative officer in the office, I came up with another way to prevent damage to the commander. Right away, I solved the problem by connecting the computer to the commander's TV and turning on the broadcast from the computer to the Internet. After solving the problem that day, I was able to solve the original problem by contacting a private company in charge of TV communications. I was able to leave the office without anything happening, and I was able to receive praise from the executives and receive a reward vacation later. I was proud of myself for solving this urgent situation after turning off the lights as a temporary measure. Since many unexpected problems arise in life, and we still have to solve them well, we will continue to respond quickly so that KT's customers do not suffer any damage from temporary measures to finish. [802.11a OFDM Communication Module Design] Since January 2016, I have been designing and implementing 802.11 OFDM wireless communication modules as graduation works. By looking for standard documents, I understand the behavior of the physical and data link layers and understand the structure and proceed with it. If I had learned the theory in the undergraduate class, now I needed to understand the overall communication process and work to improve the performance in order to implement it myself. First, I turned the simulation around through c++ coding to see if it worked properly, and I checked to what extent it can be restored even when noise and delay are added. In the next step, we added the Convolution Endoder and the Viterbi Decoder to reduce BER and PER, and checked how much performance can be improved. There were many difficulties because I had to implement the wireless communication process I learned in theory while I was working on my graduation work and understand the behavior in more detail to be able to code. However, after going through this process, I gained confidence that I would be able to say that I majored in communication. I think a general understanding of communication is essential in order to perform the network job of KT, the representative of telecommunication company, and my experience in direct implementation helped me greatly understand the network. Based on these experiences, I want to develop further in the KT network job."
