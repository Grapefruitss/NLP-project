JWT 토큰을 이용한 로그인, S3를 사용한 사진관리, HTTPS의 적용 등의 새로운 기술을 습득할 수 있었으며, 개발 도중 발생하는 여러 문제를 해결하며 문제해결능력을 기를 수 있었습니다. 그중 하나는 JPA를 다루던 도중 엔티티에 다른 테이블들을 매핑시키고 나니 무한 참조 현상이 발생하였습니다. 이러한 현상은 처음 겪다 보니 문제점의 원인을 찾기 힘들었지만 좌절하지 않고 여러 기술 블로그를 참조한 결과 잘못된 설계에서 비롯된 것이었습니다. 두 개의 엔티티가 양방향으로 매핑이 되어있었고, 데이터베이스와 서비스를 독립적으로 사용하지 않아 무한참조가 발생하는 것임을 알게 되었습니다. 결합도를 낮추기 위해 각 API에 필요한 request와 response DTO를 따로 생성해 주었습니다. 수정하는 데까지 시간이 오래 걸렸지만 DTO를 생성함으로써 필요한 정보만 골라 받고 보낼 수 있었으며, 무한 참조현상을 해결할 수 있었습니다.\\n\\n새로운 기술을 습득하려는 도전정신과 문제를 해결하려는 끈기 덕분에 성공적으로 프로젝트를 마치고 우수상을 받을 수 있었습니다. 플랫폼을 개발하며 프론트 개발에 있어서는 컴포넌트를 최대한 재사용하며 효율적으로 UI를 구성하고 코드와 파일을 간소화하여 가독성을 높였습니다. 백엔드 개발에 있어서는 기능별로 서버를 분리한 MSA 구조의 서버를 EC2 상에 구축하여 안정적인 서비스를 제공하기 위해 노력하였습니다. 또한, 추후의 유지보수를 위해 MVC 구조로 RESTfulAPI를 개발하였으며, Jenkins로 배포를 자동화하며 프로젝트 배포의 편의성을 높였습니다. 그뿐만 아니라, 여러 팀 프로젝트를 진행하며 협업하는 과정도 배울 수 있었습니다. Git을 통해 코드의 버전 관리, Swagger를 통한 프론트엔드와 백엔드의 소통을 배우고, Jira로 팀원들과 진행 상황을 공유하며 애자일을 적용한 프로젝트 수행 방법을 학습할 수 있었습니다.\\n질문\\nQ2.\\n자기소개\\n보기\\n답변\\n\"주도적인 자세가 가져온 인센티브\"\\n\\n학부 시절 학교 산학협력단에서 2년간 근로를 하며 주도적인 자세로 문제를 해결하고 인센티브를 받은 경험이 있습니다. 저의 업무 중 하나는 지출/수입결의서를 복사하는 것이었고, 이 문서들이 일주일에 1,000장 가까이 되었습니다. 많은 종이와 프린터 토너의 낭비가 심했고, 종이로 보관을 하다 보니 일의 프로세스도 효율적이지 못했습니다. 이 문서들을 스캔해서 관리하면 훨씬 효율적일 것으로 생각하였지만, 문서들을 관리하려면 새로운 프로그램의 도입이 필요하였습니다.\\n\\n따라서 직원분께 새로운 프로그램의 도입에 대해 제안을 하였고, 팀장님과 전체회의를 소집하여 해당 문제를 논의한 결과 저의 의견이 받아들여지게 되었습니다. 결과적으로, 프로그램 도입 비용이 용지 구입 비용보다 저렴하여 예산을 절약할 수 있었으며, 업무 프로세스를 개선하며 업무의 효율성을 높였습니다. 팀장님께서도 저의 노력과 성실함을 인정해주시고 전례에 없던 인센티브를 받을 수 있었습니다. 이번 경험을 통해 맡은 일에 책임감을 갖고 최선을 다하며 적극적인 자세를 가지게 되었습니다. 이러한 자세를 가지고 카카오에서 더 나은 방향을 끊임없이 고민하는 주도적인 신입사원이 되겠습니다.',\n"," '질문\\nQ1.\\n귀하를 한 단어로 표현하고, 그렇게 생각하는 이유를 구체적으로 기술해 주세요.\\n보기\\n답변\\n\"계속해서 달리는 인재\"\\n\\n저를 한 단어로 표현하면 \\'마라톤\\'이라고 생각합니다. 왜냐하면, 지난 1년 반 동안 2번의 교육과 3번의 웹 프로젝트로 웹 개발 역량을 쌓아왔으며 앞으로도 계속해서 역량을 쌓기 위해 나아갈 것이기 때문입니다.\\n학부 시절 졸업 프로젝트로 Java를 사용한 수화 번역기를 개발하면서 객체지향 프로그래밍에 매력을 느끼게 되었고, Java 기반 개발 방법론을 찾아보던 중 웹 개발에 대해 관심을 갖게 되었습니다.따라서 300시간의 \\'JAVA 프레임워크 실무 개발자 양성과정\\'에 참여해 웹 개발 기초를 쌓았습니다. 하지만 300시간으로는 웹을 이해하고 완성도 높은 프로젝트를 개발하는 것에 어려움이 있었습니다.\\n\\n이에 저는 부족한 역량을 채우기 위해 ‘OO OO OO OOOO’에 도전하게 되었고, 1년간의 웹 개발 교육을 받을 좋은 기회를 얻게 되었습니다. 6개월 동안 Spring과 vue.js 를 사용한 프론트엔드와 백엔드 모두 학습하며 웹 개발 역량을 길렀습니다. 교육을 받고 사용자 위치정보를 기반으로 한 여행 기록 플랫폼 프로젝트와 빅데이터를 사용하여 사용자 취향을 고려한 레시피 추천 프로젝트를 진행하였고, 두 번 모두 프로젝트 발표회에서 우수상을 수여할 수 있었습니다. 프로젝트를 통해 백엔드와 프론트엔드를 모두 참여하면서 풀 스택 개발 역량을 기를 수 있었습니다. 프론트 개발에 있어서는 컴포넌트를 최대한 재사용하며 효율적으로 UI를 구성하고 코드와 파일을 간소화하여 가독성을 높였습니다. 백엔드 개발에 있어서는 기능별로 서버를 분리한 MSA 구조의 서비스를 AWS 상에 구축하여 안정적인 서비스 구축하고, MVC 구조로 효율적인 RESTfulAPI를 개발하였으며, Jenkins로 배포를 자동화하며 프로젝트 배포의 편의성을 높였습니다.\\n이렇게 한가지의 길로 쭉 노력해온 만큼 앞으로도 계속해서 발전해나가는 인재라고 확신합니다.\\n질문\\nQ2.\\n해당 직무에 지원한 동기는 무엇이고, 귀하가 지원 직무에 적합하다고 생각하는 이유를 구체적인 사례를 통해 기술해 주세요.\\n보기\\n답변\\n\"3번의 프로젝트 3번의 우수상\"\\n\\nOO OO OO OOOO에서 3번의 프로젝트를 경험하며 웹 개발 역량을 쌓았습니다.

DTO는 Request/ Response에서 사용하는 View를 위한 클래스이고, 자주 변경이 필요하므로 따로 분리해서 생성하는 것이 적합하다는 것을 깨달았습니다. 이를 해결하기 위해 DTO를 따로 생성해 주었고, BeanUtils.copyProperties 메소드를 사용하여 엔티티에서 DTO로 변환해주는 작업을 수행하였습니다. 모두 수정하는 데까지 시간이 오래 걸렸지만 DTO의 필요성과 DTO가 설계서의 역할을 해준다는 것을 깨달았습니다.\\n\\n새로운 기술을 습득하려는 도전정신과 문제를 해결하려는 끈기 덕분에 성공적으로 프로젝트를 마치고 우수상을 수상할 수 있었습니다.',\n"," '질문\\nQ1.\\n당사 지원한 사유와 입사 후 포부를 기술해 주세요.
