"[Living Together] When I was in college, I practiced warmth while working as a part-timer in elections. When the work didn't end even after 3 a.m. due to the delay in counting the votes at the time of the part-time job, most of the students went back home using class as an excuse. I also had to go back home for an afternoon class, but the election watchdog staff caught my eye. I thought that if all the part-timers left, the rest of us would be many times more difficult, so I decided to stay together until the end. I fell asleep to the work that lasted all night, but each time, I went to the bathroom and washed my face with cold water, chasing after my drowsiness. After 9 p.m., everything was over, and I was served a bowl of warm rice soup with thank you from the person in charge. It was an experience where I was more physically challenged than others, but I was full of pride in being grateful to someone. I will be a new employee who actively practices followership even with Dow Technology. [Mission: Complete Your Graduation Work] When I was in college, I worked on a project to make a drone that helped me tour the campus with three colleagues. Since it was my first time encountering drones, there were many trials and errors in production. Contrary to the initial plan, additional parts were continuously generated while making the drone, which delayed the construction of the drone even with a month left before the deadline. The team members were feeling pressure due to lack of time, tired of repeated flight failures, and losing motivation. First, I suggested to the team members how to solve the problem through cooperation and motivation to do it. In addition to the existing areas, I gave them the role of supporting other team members so that they could cooperate with each other. On weekends, I visited clubs to learn how to set the basics for flying and how to operate the controller, so I was able to fly simultaneously with the production. As a result of helping each other in their fields step by step in line with the new plan, I was able to complete the project within the deadline. While you may face difficult problems while working on IT at Dow Technology, you will become a wise new employee who solves problems with a challenging attitude and goal setting. [Financial Services Convergence Training for New Human Resources] The ooo IT Education Center conducted a project to build an account management service for the team in pairs. I was in charge of designing the structure of the program and making data flow smoothly. What I thought was important while working on the project was safety and simplicity. As it was a money-related project, I put security first. When dealing with customer's personal information data, we encrypted important data through CAESAR encryption and used the post method when transmitting the data. In addition, in order to provide easy service, we used a unique value of mobile phone number as ID, minimizing the data that needs to be inputted. It was a small project, but I think it was an opportunity to indirectly experience what kind of development work I should focus on in the future as a programmer. If I join Dow Technology and participate in web application development, I will eventually become a programmer who always thinks about what kind of service is for my customers. [Habit of rewatching the light off -> Trust] The task given to me is to check every little thing meticulously. Some people say, ""Isn't it okay to move on?"" But I think it's consideration for the other person and trust with the other person to not make mistakes by checking many times. When I worked as a student at the university headquarters, I was in charge of transferring money to the total cost of issuing my certificates. I have made a habit of checking my income, expenditure, and balance more than three times in order not to make mistakes because I am dealing with public money. One day, when I found out that the balance was relatively small in the sum of the issuance costs, I informed the person in charge of the fact and took measures to correct the cost. Before transferring money, I was able to check the previous settlement of accounts and correct the wrong parts without any major problems, and I have come to be recognized as a reliable person by the person in charge. This thoroughness will serve as the basis for realizing a program that does not have errors in the web application service development work. [""Dream"" List""] My goal in life is to live a dream-like life. When I was in the military, I read a book called ""Don't Stop Stop, Start Writing Your Dream Again"" and reflected on the past days when I had only studied without any goals. Then, I started writing down the dreams I wanted to achieve one by one in my notebook. These dreams are written in various ways, ranging from small dreams such as volunteering for my neighbors in need, traveling alone, traveling the bicycle country, to the long-term dream of living around the world, and preparing a house in Seoul. These dreams are the driving force for me to live passionately. I gain confidence that I can do it by looking at the dreams I have achieved, and I am doing a compass in my life to remind myself of my goals. Also, I think dreams always come true. Even if it is a reckless dream, I believe it will come true, and if I take one step closer to my dream, I think my dream is half-achieved, just like the saying, ""The beginning is half."" Currently, my dream is to join Dow Technology. As an intern at Dow Technology, I am confident that I will be selected as a new employee by performing a given task more passionately than anyone else. Even after joining Dow Technology, I will continue to challenge myself toward my dreams and create the best life in the best company. Please give me a chance to realize my dream. [SNS Form and Shared Growth] I got to know a company called Dow Technology through my junior who experienced an internship in Dow Technology QA department. I heard that it is a solid company with diverse and stable business models in the Internet service field. I did not know much about it because there are more businesses targeting B2B than B2C, but I found out that the services I have actually used such as UNICRO and payment agency are those provided by Dow Technology. I want to join Dow Technology and work on SNS Form development. I think it is a service that understands the needs of customers well with the catchphrase 'Anyone can easily and conveniently use SNS shopping platform'.In an era when the boundaries between sellers and buyers are blurred and anyone can become a seller, I think easy and fast social platforms are attractive services to individual customers. I will become a new employee who is growing up with SNS Form by participating in the SNS activation contest of shopping mall A, listening to customers and drawing out needs, and using my experience in payment-related projects in the process of converging financial services."
"1. While taking object-oriented programming A+ and programming classes, I became interested in WEP/APP development as I realized that the process of making and modifying programs is similar to the process of solving math problems that I have liked since I was young. 2. Database design A0, I learned how to use the language and programs needed to design the database and analyze big data. 3. I took Computer Graphics Design A0, Computer Graphics Design course, and I learned how to use Computer Graphics by creating 3D space and creating objects using OpenGL. I took the Big Data Manager course run by the Koreaoo Association to design databases such as Java, Oracle, Hadoop, and R, and learned the language and how to use the programs needed to analyze big data. Also, I was not satisfied with simply taking classes, and I was able to get the experience I needed for actual use by conducting a mini-project every time I learned a program, and I am working on a graduation project to design a database related to patents and a system that searches for the desired information in them. Since NHN Entertainment is a company that provides IT services based on life and culture, I think it is most important to develop programs that many users can conveniently use. After joining the company, I will try to produce performance that satisfies users to develop programs that customers need, not simply to develop to produce results."
"After graduating from high school, I came back to prepare for college. I wanted to make up for my lack of study through an academy, but most of all, I didn't want to put a financial burden on my parents, so I had a lot of worries. I gathered a lot of information to find out that there is a system that allows me to take classes for free while working at a college academy, and after the interview, I was able to work as a work scholarship and take classes. When I think about it now, the working life of the 20-year-old re-examination academy was the first step in society. Classes that involve as few as 100 people and as many as 300 people were divided among 20 work scholars, and before the class started, 20 work such as chalking for lectures and checking the status of the microphone was done together. Particularly during the vacation period, many lectures were held, and more students than students came to take famous lectures on a regular basis. Due to the large number of lectures held, there were situations where several classrooms overlapped to prepare. However, the work scholarship students not only did their job, but also took the time to help each other to resolve the shortage of manpower, and realized that cooperation is a strong force to solve difficulties together. I was able to have valuable experiences to learn the ability to organize, to be responsible, and to cooperate while working as a student at a college for nearly a year. In order to build my competence as a developer, I have developed problem-solving and collaboration skills by efficiently utilizing the semester and vacation to engage in various activities such as competitions, participation in hackathon competitions, and overseas clubs. In particular, during the semester, I participated in software competitions every year by setting the goal of winning the award by selecting the skills and services I wanted to study and make. I achieved my goals every year and won the competition in both 2015 and 2016. While taking school class, I studied new skills on my own and worked on a project, so I was burdened with time, but I think the reason I was able to succeed was because I enjoyed it. I was able to have fun while studying the skills I wanted to use and completing the projects one by one through those skills. In addition, when I encountered difficulties in unknown errors while developing, I was able to develop my ability to solve problems by solving them by myself by searching the Internet step by step with the error door as a clue. I am confident that I was able to succeed as a synergy effect because I studied what I wanted to do and had fun in the process, not because it was mandatory. My motivation for applying for ""The Zone Bizon"" was to think that the appearance of constant challenges matched my values. In addition, I was convinced that the competencies I had prepared so far were optimized for the ERP/web development job in ""The Zone Bizon"". In order to build my competence as a developer, I have developed important collaboration skills and problem-solving skills as a developer by efficiently utilizing semesters and vacations through various activities such as external clubs, competition awards, and hackathon competitions. When I do web projects through various projects through php, jsp model 2, spring framework, I have accumulated the concepts and capabilities necessary for web projects. Currently, I am learning a sense of practice by developing a sponsor system used by universities through the spring framework, and I think the experience of the sponsor management program, which develops functions for work in the university development room, is a miniature version of ERP development. Therefore, I am confident that the process and development logic experienced while planning and developing will enable me to quickly adapt to the ERP/WEB development department and faithfully perform my duties to contribute to the project. During my college life, I participated in joint development clubs, competitions, hackathon competitions, and other projects with my colleagues. I have developed collaboration skills and problem-solving skills through various activities, such as completing the results in 3 days and 2 nights by working with first-timers right away. While working on projects with office workers and designers through the joint club, I was able to discuss ideas and learn UI/UX from the perspective of weak users by having meetings with designers. In addition, while developing with an office worker who is developing in practice, I was able to learn parts that are difficult for students to understand, such as RSS parsing and effective code laws. Currently, we are developing a system that is outsourced to a ""supporters' association management system"" and uses it immediately upon completion of development. We discussed the requirements through a month-long meeting with the staff, coordinated and documented each other, and designed the client part of the system and the database. After the database design was completed, we are completing the development by dividing the roles with the team members. I am confident that the web development department will be able to quickly adapt, faithfully fulfill its role, and contribute to the improvement of the entire ""Djohn Bizon"" and service."

I am confident that I am second to none in terms of technical skills, responsibility, and patience that a developer should have. I will make the best of my abilities and meet the expectations of NICE information and communication. Since I was young, I have been praised for having a unique idea by surprising people around me by drawing pictures of future undersea cities, food, and fashion that others have never imagined. I was interested in programming that allowed me to freely realize these unique ideas and naturally went on to major in computer engineering. In order to develop a new concept of service that others could not come up with, I tried to build up my competence as a developer by completing a number of programming expert courses at oo Academy, an educational institution for development experts as well as majoring in university. As the first step in surprising the world with unique ideas, I founded a fashion shopping mall called 'OO' a year ago. We tried to provide the trust and convenience of customers through the operation method called 'pre-check payment after payment', which is differentiated from the existing shopping mall called 'pre-check after payment'. In addition, through the concept of providing personalized styling services, we tried to be competitive with existing shopping malls and targeted niche markets by targeting men rather than women as our main customer base. Naturally, this became the first opportunity in the shopping mall industry to realize individualized O2O styling services for men, and returns and refunds have occurred at an average rate of 4% lower than competitors. Based on these results, we were able to get an opportunity to be selected as a nurturing start-up for SK Planet.However, despite these achievements, I encountered unexpected difficulties while developing the service due to the disadvantage of trying to solve any problem alone. During the implementation of the payment system, the PHP-based code sample and manual provided by the payment PG company were very different from the server platform Node.js, which I implemented, which was difficult to implement. I tried to search for PHP programming books and the Internet, but I wasted five days. Eventually, I asked the payment PG for help, and I felt a great sense of despondency when I learned that it was a problem that could be solved simply in a day. As a result, when a problem arises, I try to solve it quickly by approaching anyone first, asking them, and learning. Although there were many difficulties while developing the service due to its shortcomings, the responsibility of being 'the owner of the service is me' was the driving force that led to the commercialization of the shopping mall service. It was not easy to develop the service's front/back-end alone because I was the only developer in a start-up team composed of various majors. However, this start-up started with my idea, and after staying up all night in the office for three months with a sense of responsibility that no one else could take charge of development, I was able to implement and commercialize the service within the target period. Through the start-up of a fashion shopping mall, I practiced 'passion' and 'challenge' by creating the first male personal styling service that was not found in existing shopping malls, and I decided that the 'professionalism' of running out of school to develop a solid service and entering a development professional education institution directly matched NICE's talent image and applied."
"I think there is a great potential for the development of financial it. Recently, the domestic financial industry has eased a lot of regulations on it, but it is being incorporated in various ways. So I thought that the job of financial it has a great potential for development and I will be able to expand my capabilities. The new future of financial it, which is the vision of Lotte Capital, is the same as the dream I want to achieve in my job. Lotte Capital's goal is to develop new and diverse financial products using information and communication technology to meet the diverse needs of consumers, thereby enhancing the benefits of society as a whole, and I applied to Lotte Capital because I thought it would be great if I could demonstrate my capabilities and support them. I will try to exert a higher synergy effect by adding Lotte Capital's capabilities, such as segmented financial products and leased products, and my capabilities in business administration/it. I am a person who is responsible for the results. My father worked abroad for about 10 years from my elementary school to high school. My father worked for a construction company and worked in the Middle East. After entering high school, I began to study far away. Then, while I was video chatting with my father during my second year of high school summer vacation, he said, ""I believe in you. I was able to work with my family because I believed in you. He said, ""Don't trust me in the future."" I shed tears. Since then, I have decided to change and actually acted. I thought I should take responsibility for what I am doing. However, I lacked the basics and I spent a year re-offending life after I was a high school senior. There is something I gained by successfully spending that year. It is self-control. I studied according to the set rules every day for a year. It was very difficult to study a set time and a set amount every day. But I thought it was a promise to myself and studied hard for a year. So I think I gained high self-control through re-examination. I have developed a strong mental strength to overcome long project tasks or intense tasks in my job at Lotte Capital it. [Eye-level Education] I was able to learn how to think from the other person's point of view when I provide after-school educational services to children in need at home. Children who have difficulty at home cannot go to private academies, so they receive after-school education at social welfare centers run by local governments or volunteer organizations. I did educational services to children in elementary and middle schools during the vacation at Yeonmu Welfare Center and Seongmin Social Welfare Center. When I first met them, they were very wary of me. So I asked my teacher how I could make friends with them. She said I should look at them from their perspective. In the next volunteer class, I brought chocolates, gave them a quiz, and gave them a gift. After doing this, the children approached me without hesitation. Through this experience, I realized that when I treat children, I have to look at them from their perspective. When I tried to teach them right away because I went to educational service, they felt burdened. First of all, I needed time to get close to my children, and in order to get close, I had to think from their perspective. Through this process, I think the same is true when dealing with customers. I think the process of thinking about what convenience and benefits will be from the customer's point of view is an essential process to perform an IT job. First, I studied the web, Java, and DB while working on a shopping mall production project using JSP and MYSQL, who have accumulated sufficient capabilities. In this process, I was able to learn password encryption and error page processing that I did not know in the past, and I studied how several pages were organically combined. Second, a steady researcher completed the course of oracle database sql/workshop1/2 over a month in February 2016, and studied the architecture of db and various memories in oracle db for efficiently constructing sql. In addition, during the weekend of March and June, I completed a curriculum called analyzing security weaknesses through mock hacking, and used linux to penetrate the server and analyze which part was vulnerable. Even after graduating from school, I am constantly developing myself and building up my capabilities. I have the advantage of being able to understand the other person's intentions well. At the time of the scout intern, I was asked to do short research in a short time. Although I did not have enough time, I set my own standards and researched them according to my priorities. Through this experience, I will find and deal with tasks with them first among many tasks with a high priority. On the other hand, my weakness is the lack of efficient time distribution for multiple tasks. I learned this at university and after that, I put a time limit on one task. So, when there is a set time, I perform other tasks to prevent myself from being overly immersed in one task. These efforts have led to fewer mistakes even when I have to handle tasks at the same time. First of all, in the beginning of the job, I will finish studying information security that I am currently studying, and after that, I will figure out the work and think about how to melt what I learned in the department class and what I learned in external education into my work. In dealing with future tasks, I will not only study programming languages but also create experiences in the business together. This is because it is difficult to pursue efficiency if you do not know how other departments' tasks are handled due to the nature of financial it. In addition, in the it sector, which has up to it 4 teams, we will actively interact with other teams to promote unity of the it team, and through the synergy effect, higher work efficiency and information sharing are possible. The it job always has to think about optimal efficiency and how to reduce cost and time in the process. I think that in order to achieve this, the it team should have more information about other departments and also more information sharing between the it team."
"The person who made the biggest difference in my life is my father. My father worked abroad for about 10 years from my elementary school to high school. My father worked for a construction company and worked in the Middle East. After entering high school, I started to keep away from studying. Then, while I was video chatting with my father during my second year of high school summer vacation, my father said, ""I trust you. I have been able to work with my family because I believe in you. I told him not to trust him in the future."" I shed tears. Since then, I have decided to change and actually acted. Since then, I have tried not to break promises with others and myself. Not only am I not late for the appointment with my friends, but I also focused on completing the study time I set myself. As a result, I succeeded in my re-examination and I was able to grow into a responsible person who gives trust to others. I think securities are the flower of the economy. I think all kinds of elements of the economy come together to form a stock market, and stocks come together to form a stock market. The first reason I became interested in securities was after learning about option investment in one of my major classes. I became more interested in securities by making a simulation investment that created synthetic options. I will figure out my work and think about how I can incorporate what I learned in my department class and what I learned in external education into my work. In dealing with future tasks, I will not only study programming languages but also have experience in business together. This is because it is difficult to pursue efficiency if you do not know how other departments' work is handled due to the nature of finance it. Based on these efforts, I will maximize the synergy effect of the it team in 10 years to make Shinyoung Securities a leader in the finance it world. I have the experience of overcoming crises with my active attitude. When I was in college, I worked as a group supporter. One of the supporters' activities was to distribute wet wipes and fans only to citizens who took the quiz. However, the planned day was so hot that citizens were not interested in us. The team members' motivation also declined. So I came up with an idea by taking the lead in order to increase the team members' motivation and successfully finish the mission. They didn't give us a gift when we got the quiz right, but they made some changes by giving us a gift first and giving a quiz. The citizens who received the gift didn't turn away from us. In just one hour, we filled out all the number of quizzes we wanted. I took the lead in solving the team's problems and encouraged my team members by offering opinions. Throughout my life, I have found that giving active opinions on something can be a clue to a solution, even if it is not the perfect answer. My outlook on life is 'Let's live a life looking around.' I had this outlook on life because of my experience living in the country. I went to elementary school in the country, and the most memorable teacher was the teacher who was in charge when I was in the fourth grade. Knowing that my father was on a long business trip abroad at the time, the teacher treated me like he was, and I was able to listen to him and build my self-reliance. Although I lost contact now, at that time, I thought that when I grew up, I wanted to help children like you. So I joined a university and spent my vacation doing volunteer work. I have experience in volunteer work while teaching elementary and middle school students at Seongmin Social Welfare Center and Yeonmu Welfare Center. I enjoyed the time to meet with children while volunteering, and I was even more happy if the children understood the concept properly. Through volunteer work, I raised my self-esteem and became more responsible in my life. I remember playing the role of PM in designing the project the most. I have experience in carrying out a parking lot management project in my major class, System Analysis and Design. I designed scenarios for each process and carefully analyzed how the system was executed. The biggest difficulty in the project was the difficulty in communicating between team members. For example, everyone agreed on the opinion of A, but it turned out that team members knew A as A+ or A-, not A. As this happened repeatedly, confusion occurred among team members. So I later created a terminology summary file to prevent confusion in the project. Through this experience, I learned that even colleagues who are handling the same task may have different views. Based on this, if I work on a project at Shinyoung Securities, I will be passionate and share accurate information with my colleagues to help me with the project. The most memorable thing is that I did a shopping mall project using JSP in system design and analysis. Implementing shopping mall sites for each team was a task at the end of the semester. Our team built a web server using JSP, AJAX's jQuery, mysql, and tomcat at the time. At that time, three people divided the JSP page, script page, and dbbean page and were in charge of each other. I remember gradually completing the homepage during the semester, and when the semester was over, I was impressed with my team members when I saw that the homepage that ran properly was completed. The reason this project was most memorable was that the professor told me that our team's shopping mall was implemented the most properly. It is because the various variables and page names exchanged between pages were set up intuitively and easily recognized."
"Looking back on myself, I think I always liked learning new things. I liked sports since I was young, so I learned various sports. When I was in college, I also joined a club and worked out. In the second year, I wanted to learn a field other than my major, so I learned a job through marketing school. After learning the job, I applied it to the field and worked, and after graduation, I wanted to harmonize with my major, so I interned. There, I experienced not only the marketing work, but also the culture and social life of the company through various experiences in the field and conversations with colleagues. Finally, I did research on processing big data as the subject of the graduation project before graduation. Usually, other students proceed with the project with what they learned in their undergraduate school, such as making an application or making a web as a graduation project. However, my team member and I decided to proceed with this topic because we wanted to study big data, which is a hot issue, not what we learned in the undergraduate school. I decided to work on the project by choosing each role with my team members, but it was not something I learned in undergraduate school, so I had a hard time in the middle because of difficulties from the installation process, but I was able to overcome the difficulties thanks to the team members who asked for advice from professors and graduate school seniors, studied and researched together. My major is computer engineering, and it is a software-oriented class, so I could take a lot of SW-related classes. The SW-related subjects I took are object-oriented programming, system software, Java programming, computer graphics, high-performance computing, artificial intelligence, and database. Among them, the class I was interested in was called database application, which I learned in the 4th grade. Through that class, I was able to first encounter DB, and at the same time, I was able to help me understand the big data that was in progress as a graduation project. I was able to practice 3-4 of DB-related software, and I was able to learn how to model DB (requirement analysis, normalization, and ER diagram) by choosing one application. I think big data is the most valuable industry these days. I think the value varies greatly depending on how much data a company has and how much data it can use. Accordingly, I am confident that I will be able to become an employee that Humax expects through learning through various programming and graduation projects learned in the undergraduate school. After listening to marketing training before taking a leave of absence, I always thought, 'I want to be a creative engineer.' However, my major is computer engineering, not marketing, so I wanted to work in marketing. So, after taking a leave of absence, I started an internship in sales support and marketing at an IT solution company in 2013. When I first started working, the department in charge was newly established, so there was no framework. First of all, I thought that my understanding of the company was my top priority, so I studied IT solutions. Also, I didn't forget to read and study marketing-related books because there were many things I didn't know about the marketing field. After that, I announced the schedule through weekly meetings. I worked on revising the homepage, producing and sending eDM, producing and guiding promotions, and working on documents. I had never done anything except document work, so I studied, searched, and made it by myself. As a result, even before I finished my internship, my boss suggested me to change to a full-time job as well as raise my salary. I am a person who always tries and challenges to achieve what I want. Even after joining Humax, I will always try and challenge myself with a constant mind. Since I was young, I have been told that I am mature for my age due to my deep thought and consideration. However, I have a fiery personality when it comes to things that I don't think are right. Because of this, I misunderstand that my personality is not good, but when I look at it two or three times, everyone knows and understands the reason. However, I always try to fix it because I know that it is a bad thing to make people misunderstand. When I started interning at work after taking a leave of absence, I had weekly reports and team meetings through weekly meetings. At first, the weekly meeting was burdensome, so I summarized it briefly and proceeded quickly. However, the reason for the meeting is to share opinions with others and receive feedback from each other, so I organized the materials for the meeting the day before. And when I start working, I am doing my job as accurately and quickly as possible. I ask my seniors about things I don't know and search for materials on my own to work. Because of this reason, I think I worked full-time when I was an intern."
"The reason I applied for ""SureSoft Tech"" was that I applied in line with the values of preparing for a new leap by constantly preparing for innovation without stopping at my current position. At the same time, I was convinced that the job competencies I had accumulated in activities such as external activities, competitions, and competitions were suitable for my job. While collaborating with various people, I have been working on various projects through technologies such as php, jsp, and spring framework, and I have gained experience by solidly studying technologies and concepts. In addition, when winning the mobile application implemented using hybrid app technology at the App Competition hosted by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Food, I was proved my job competencies that I have accumulated so far. I am confident that I can contribute by quickly learning and adapting to work at ""SureSoft Tech"" through various experiences along with such consistent values. If I have a title while working after joining the company, I would like to receive a second name as ""a developer who provides stable services."" As I develop, I think it is good and important to develop a program while applying new technologies while following the flow of technology. However, the most important thing while using the program is to provide stable services to users with fewer errors, and I think the more important the service is to provide useful information to many people. Therefore, I will study the service performance necessary to develop stable services while learning and learning the work properly through the experiences and capabilities I have gained. This is because the implementation of efficient performance leads to stable services. Therefore, I deeply studied java programming through a book called ""Java Performance Tuning."" After joining the company, I will provide more convenient and stable services to customers by building up the ability for stable services by working as a SW inspection at ""Suresoft Tech,"" and I will grow up preparing for the future with ""Suresoft Tech."" After graduating from high school, I challenged the college entrance exam once again. I wanted to make up for my lack of study through the academy, but more than anything, I didn't want to put financial burden on my parents, so I had to think about many things. After gathering a lot of information, I came to understand that there is a system that allows me to take classes for free while working at a college academy, and after the interview, I was able to take classes while working as a work scholarship student. Looking back, the first step in society was working at the 20-year-old cram school. Twenty scholarships shared roles in classes where as many as 100 students and as many as 300 students participated, and before the class started, 20 students worked together on cleaning up the class, including chalking and microphone status checks. Particularly during the vacation period, many lectures were held, and more students than students came to take famous lectures on a regular basis. Due to the large number of lectures taking place, there were situations where several classrooms to prepare overlapped. However, I came to realize that cooperation is a strong force to solve difficulties together by taking the time to help each other, as well as doing what they were assigned to. I was able to learn about my ability to organize, responsibility, and cooperation while living as a student at a college academy for nearly a year. Also, I was able to realize that it depends on what kind of situation I think it is and that it can be a valuable experience depending on my actions. I am confident that I can always use this mindset to contribute to the development of the service of ""Suresoft Tech."" It is a strength of my personality to immerse myself in challenging myself until I have solved the questions. As an example, I was interested in the technologies I normally use in practice and emerging technologies, so I heard a technology called log4j while talking to an acquaintance who is working in practice. It was a technology that is used a lot in practice and is mostly used by practitioners, but it was unfamiliar at the time. After returning home, I was so curious that I couldn't fall asleep that I ended up turning on my laptop and looking for related materials. As a result of looking it up, I found out that there were a lot of materials and that it was a bug-related technology, and recently, I found out that I am using a more complementary technology called logback more. As I learned the main purpose of using the technology and the current flow of use, my curiosity was solved, but I had a desire to apply it to the project based on the data I looked up. Thus, I did not finish solving my questions but applied them to personal projects, and in the process of applying them to personal projects, I organized them once more and posted them on my blog to make sure that what I studied in the process of applying them to personal projects. I became interested in using RSS after seeing that I used a lot of RSS around me, so I did a personal project using RSS. While working on the project, there was a problem that I had no experience in spring and that RSS was unfamiliar. Since it is my first time in the case of spring, I thought it would be good to proceed based on reference materials, so I asked the professor to study the materials that the seniors conducted in class. I applied the parts that were not in the reference materials to the project by filling in the gaps by searching the Internet and referring to the information on the community site. However, in the case of RSS, it took a lot of time because it was completely unfamiliar. I also searched for RSS, and I asked my acquaintances I knew while doing external activities, but I couldn't get the answer I wanted because it was unfamiliar. However, I really wanted to solve the questions, so I kept searching and looking for it, and I found that fetching information through RSS was also a kind of parsing. I searched the Internet with the keyword parsing, and I tested it starting with html parsing. Later, I found a library called Jsoup and successfully used it to get the information I wanted through RSS and use it in the format I wanted.After importing and processing the information, I thought it would be better to summarize the article and show only the important parts, so I thought it would be better to implement and apply the paragraph summary algorithm myself. I thought about what to do with the logic of the paragraph summary algorithm, and eventually, I prioritized the paragraphs through checking the frequency and frequency of words, implemented the algorithm, and applied it to the information that was imported by parsing. Although there were several crises like this, I was able to achieve the desired results by solving them one by one. I could feel once again that if I was willing to do something that was difficult while working on the project, there must be a way. We have prepared a public data contest to take on a new challenge through the capabilities we have accumulated so far. In the process of planning, the team members thought a lot about what kind of novel service to make using public data provided by the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. While looking for good public data to use, I found public data related to livestock diseases, and I thought about how it would be possible to find animal diseases directly through the symptoms identified through the user's naked eyes. I immediately looked into whether there was a service on the subject of human diseases, but found out that there was no animal and livestock-related disease service. I immediately presented my opinions to the team members and received positive responses from other team members, so I decided to choose the core service as the subject of animal and livestock diseases. In addition, by adding a function that directly shows the nearby animal hospital and a service that informs you of the latest epidemic in real time, we launched a service called ""My Own Veterinarian"" and received the second prize in the competition. While working on several projects, I learned that the ability and knowledge to develop are important, but algorithmic thinking skills are very important. For example, if you write a code that adds up by adding 1 to 10, it is usually implemented through repetitive sentences, but if algorithmic thinking ability and experience are added, you can come up with a code that improves temporal performance by applying a method such as an equal sequence rather than a repetitive sentence. As a result, we gathered people to learn algorithms every week to achieve algorithmic consumption. Each person solves algorithm problems for a set amount of time, takes turns reviewing the code, and analyzing the other person's code. Like this, I was able to develop my thinking ability by seeing the implementation method that I could not think of when I studied alone, and I am growing more through constant meetings."
"[Turning crises into opportunities is the spirit of challenge.] After graduating from high school, I tried again for college entrance exams. I wanted to make up for my lack of study through an academy, but more than anything else, I didn't want to burden my parents financially, so I had to think about it. I wanted to make money from part-time jobs by focusing on studying as much as possible, but after gathering a lot of information, I found out that there is a system that allows me to take classes for free while working at a college academy, and I was able to take classes while working as a scholarship student after an interview. Now that I think about it, the working life of the 20-year-old re-examination academy was the first step in society. Classes that require as many as 100 students and as many as 300 students were divided into roles, and before the class started, 20 scholarships worked together to clean up the class, such as chalking and microphone status checking. Particularly during the vacation period, many lectures were held, and more students than students came to take famous lectures on a regular basis. Due to the large number of lectures held, there was a situation where several classrooms that had to be prepared overlapped. However, the labor scholarship students took the time to help each other, not only to do their job, but also to solve the shortage of manpower, and realized that cooperation is a strong force that can solve difficulties together. I had a valuable experience to learn the ability to organize, to be responsible, and to work together while I was a labor scholarship student at the college for nearly a year. [Curious, meticulous, and immersed!] It is a strength of my personality to immerse myself in challenging myself until I can solve the questions. As an example, I was interested in the skills I normally use in practice and emerging technologies, so I was told a technology called log4j while talking to an acquaintance working in practice. It was a technology that is widely used in practice and used by practitioners, but it was unfamiliar at the time. After returning home, I was so curious that I couldn't sleep, so I turned on my laptop and looked for related materials. As a result of looking it up, I found out that there were a lot of materials and that it was a bug-related technology, and recently, I found out that I am using a more complementary technology called logback more. As I learned the main purpose of using technology and the current flow of use, my curiosity was solved, but I had a desire to apply it to a project based on the data I looked for. Thus, I did not end up solving my curiosity, but applied it to my personal project, and in the process of applying it to my personal project, I organized it one more time and posted it on my blog to make sure that what I had studied was my own, and then fell asleep. The downside is that focusing on one thing takes precedence in everything. In order to compensate for my shortcomings, I am making my shortcomings a strength by prioritizing whether there is anything more important before I start and putting them into action. Along with thorough management to check the priorities of work, I will focus on ideas and recent technologies that can improve the service of the ""Hankook Ilbo"" to prepare for the future and use them to grow together. [Best friends to match the ""Hankook Ilbo""!] Satisfied with its current position, the ""Hankook Ilbo"" has provided services to customers with a clear direction and goal and has developed without stopping. As such, we have supported the values that we challenge with sustainable growth and the mindset for our customers. In the Hankook Ilbo, I have accumulated the necessary job competencies as an IT developer through various activities such as external activities, contests, and contests. Through various technologies such as php, jsp, and spring framework with various people such as office workers, designers, planners, etc., I was able to develop my problem-solving skills and collaboration skills. In addition, I have gained experience by studying the technologies and concepts necessary for web development by intensively working on web projects. In addition, I studied hybrid app technology and received the award by opening my own veterinarian service by challenging at an app competition hosted by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Food. I am confident that these accumulated job competencies can be used to quickly build small-scale mobile services through hybrid apps, and that I can contribute to providing quick and stable services to customers through the development and development of web services. [Developer who provides stable web services!] After deciding on a career path, I have developed the concept and development ability of the web by focusing on web projects through various activities and challenges such as development clubs, contests, and competitions. That's why I am confident that I will be able to display my skills even more when I work on web development. If I join the Hankook Ilbo and develop a service in charge of web development, I will become a developer who provides stable service to customers. While developing, it is important to follow the flow of technology while applying new technologies, but I think the most important thing is to provide stable service to users with fewer errors. Therefore, I will focus on studying and developing the service performance necessary to develop stable service while learning and learning the work correctly through the accumulated experience and capabilities. This is because the implementation of efficient performance leads to stable service. Therefore, I even studied Java programming deeply by myself through a book called ""Java Performance Tuning."" After joining the company, I will provide more convenient and stable service to customers through my immersion in technology for stable service, and I will prepare and grow for the future with the Hankook Ilbo. [Algebraic Consumption!] While working on the project, I learned that the ability and knowledge to develop are important, but algorithmic thinking ability is very important. For example, if you write a code that adds 1 to 10 to obtain a sum, you usually use repetitions, but if algorithmic thinking and experience are added, you can come up with a code that improves temporal performance by applying an equi-order sequence rather than repetitions. As a result, we gathered people to create our own algorithmic consumption and conducted algorithm learning every week.Each of them is studying while analyzing the other's code while taking turns reviewing the code after solving algorithm problems for a set amount of time. As such, I was able to develop my thinking ability by seeing the implementation method that I couldn't think of when studying alone, and I am growing more through constant meetings."
"[Choice and concentration] My first choice is to have various part-time job experiences such as cafes, movie theaters, pubs, and office assistants. There were times when I felt physically and mentally difficult while studying and economic activities at the same time, but I faithfully performed it with a sense of responsibility for my work. Because of this sense of responsibility, I have been steadily doing what I started once by building trust for more than six months. Especially when I was working part-time at a movie theater, I actively welcomed customers thinking about what kind of service I wanted to receive from the customer's point of view, and I got the unexpected result of ""being kind and smiling."" The second choice and concentration was studying. In fact, even until the second year, after spending time due to vague about career path, I started to pay attention to web development-related fields in the second half of the second year. I focused on my studies, feeling that I lacked basic skills, but there were limitations. However, as I came to think about ways to improve my practical skills without giving up, I was able to broaden my experience through activities of the joint development club, and I have developed collaboration skills and problem-solving skills that are important to developers by using competitions and blogs. As a result, I was able to raise my GPA from 3.0 to 3.41, and I was able to develop not only my academic performance but also my competency required for my work. As such, the sense of accomplishment gained through the goals established through the selection and concentration was a valuable experience that could not be exchanged for anything else. I am sure that such selection and concentration will show efficient and successful results by focusing on the task assigned to the ""Simplex Internet."" [What turns a crisis into an opportunity is the spirit of challenge.] After graduating from high school, I decided to retake the class. I wanted to make up for my lack of study through an academy, but more than anything else, I didn't want to put financial burden on my parents, so I had to think about it. As I wanted to earn money by focusing on studying as much as possible, I learned that there is a system that allows me to take classes for free while working at a college, and after an interview, I was able to take classes while working as a scholarship student. Now that I think about it, working at the 20-year-old cram school was the first step in society. Twenty scholarship students shared roles in classes with as few as 100 students and as many as 300 students, and before the class started, they worked together on cleaning up the lecture's chalk and microphone status. Particularly during the vacation, many lectures were held, and more students than students usually came to take famous lectures. Due to the large number of lectures held, there was a situation where several classrooms to prepare overlapped. However, the scholarship students took the time to help each other, not just do their job, but took the time to resolve the shortage of manpower, and realized that cooperation is a strong force to solve difficulties together. While I was working as a student at a college for nearly a year, I had a valuable experience to learn about organizing skills, responsibility, and cooperation. I am confident that the organizing ability, responsibility, and cooperation learned through the growth process must strengthen the bond between the ""Simplex Internet"" and create synergy to increase work efficiency and contribute to it. The strength of my personality is that I am responsible for what I decide. After entering university, I became the first-year representative of the department. While playing a public role, I personally wanted to help my classmates. As I was taking the class, I found that my classmates, who entered the required liberal arts course called ""college mathematics"" from liberal arts in high school, had difficulty keeping up with the class. I started to post the solutions on the cafe by solving the materials and problems that I had organized every week, and I posted and shared the organized materials for friends in need to refer to them by setting a period and time. It wasn't easy because it wasn't a one-time event, but I exchanged information through the cafe without missing out, and I received a ""thank you"" from my friends who helped me. On the other hand, I was told that I was sad that I was neglected by meetings with my friends due to my strong responsibility for work. I tried to make a habit of taking notes carefully on my calendar and notepad in order to overcome the part of neglecting other tasks when I started working and was immersed in it, so that I could pay attention to the details. In addition, I communicated by saying the circumstances in which I was neglected by my friends, and I contacted my friends first to actively respond, so that I could solve them wisely. [You have to get together!] Until now, I have lived with the mind of ""Let's grow together while helping."" Although it may be easy to see it simply, the word ""Let's grow together while helping"" has a lot of meaning and requires a lot of effort. You need a sense of responsibility to faithfully fulfill your role through role division, and you also need to be supportive of persistence to keep responsibility. Helping others is because you need passion to help while doing your part. It takes a lot of effort like this, but it's because I have my own values that are confident that being together while helping can create synergy with each other and lead to good results. That's why even when I'm working on a team project, I've been working hard to become a person who can help by studying about the project more than others. [A challenging developer] In order to build my competence as a developer, I voluntarily participated in a development club during the vacation and carried out the project. During the semester, I tried to communicate through various experiences while challenging a software competition. Among them, I was able to improve my skills through competitions and hackathon. During the semester, we prepared for the competition held at the university under the theme of ""Web Service for Club Introduction and Support"" in groups of two. The server was developed with an MVC structure, jsp (model 2). Since I had never learned JSP and there was a fixed period for submitting results, I stayed until late at night after school class and studied the shortcomings by reading the Internet and books during the service planning to participate in the competition.I proceeded with the project with tension because I had to complete and present for three months while studying with two people. At this time, I was able to understand the concept of MVC structure and develop my ability to use Internet search. In addition, I was able to experience how the programming called Java, which I learned in school, was applied and used in the project. As a result of concentrating on it, I fell in love with it so passionately that it felt like the period was short, and I even got an unexpected award. And the sense of accomplishment came to me as a value more than effort. In addition, by participating in the hackathon held for two nights and three days, I developed the ability to quickly apply the language I studied by developing a web service that shares street performance information with developers, designers, and planners through PHP. I am sure that the ability that I have developed steadily will quickly adapt as a family to the ""Simplex Internet"" and become one and play my role as one, while at the same time being able to help others."
