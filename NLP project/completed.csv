"[Living Together] When I was in college, I practiced warmth while working as a part-timer in elections. When the work didn't end even after 3 a.m. due to the delay in counting the votes at the time of the part-time job, most of the students went back home using class as an excuse. I also had to go back home for an afternoon class, but the election watchdog staff caught my eye. I thought that if all the part-timers left, the rest of us would be many times more difficult, so I decided to stay together until the end. I fell asleep to the work that lasted all night, but each time, I went to the bathroom and washed my face with cold water, chasing after my drowsiness. After 9 p.m., everything was over, and I was served a bowl of warm rice soup with thank you from the person in charge. It was an experience where I was more physically challenged than others, but I was full of pride in being grateful to someone. I will be a new employee who actively practices followership even with Dow Technology. [Mission: Complete Your Graduation Work] When I was in college, I worked on a project to make a drone that helped me tour the campus with three colleagues. Since it was my first time encountering drones, there were many trials and errors in production. Contrary to the initial plan, additional parts were continuously generated while making the drone, which delayed the construction of the drone even with a month left before the deadline. The team members were feeling pressure due to lack of time, tired of repeated flight failures, and losing motivation. First, I suggested to the team members how to solve the problem through cooperation and motivation to do it. In addition to the existing areas, I gave them the role of supporting other team members so that they could cooperate with each other. On weekends, I visited clubs to learn how to set the basics for flying and how to operate the controller, so I was able to fly simultaneously with the production. As a result of helping each other in their fields step by step in line with the new plan, I was able to complete the project within the deadline. While you may face difficult problems while working on IT at Dow Technology, you will become a wise new employee who solves problems with a challenging attitude and goal setting. [Financial Services Convergence Training for New Human Resources] The ooo IT Education Center conducted a project to build an account management service for the team in pairs. I was in charge of designing the structure of the program and making data flow smoothly. What I thought was important while working on the project was safety and simplicity. As it was a money-related project, I put security first. When dealing with customer's personal information data, we encrypted important data through CAESAR encryption and used the post method when transmitting the data. In addition, in order to provide easy service, we used a unique value of mobile phone number as ID, minimizing the data that needs to be inputted. It was a small project, but I think it was an opportunity to indirectly experience what kind of development work I should focus on in the future as a programmer. If I join Dow Technology and participate in web application development, I will eventually become a programmer who always thinks about what kind of service is for my customers. [Habit of rewatching the light off -> Trust] The task given to me is to check every little thing meticulously. Some people say, ""Isn't it okay to move on?"" But I think it's consideration for the other person and trust with the other person to not make mistakes by checking many times. When I worked as a student at the university headquarters, I was in charge of transferring money to the total cost of issuing my certificates. I have made a habit of checking my income, expenditure, and balance more than three times in order not to make mistakes because I am dealing with public money. One day, when I found out that the balance was relatively small in the sum of the issuance costs, I informed the person in charge of the fact and took measures to correct the cost. Before transferring money, I was able to check the previous settlement of accounts and correct the wrong parts without any major problems, and I have come to be recognized as a reliable person by the person in charge. This thoroughness will serve as the basis for realizing a program that does not have errors in the web application service development work. [""Dream"" List""] My goal in life is to live a dream-like life. When I was in the military, I read a book called ""Don't Stop Stop, Start Writing Your Dream Again"" and reflected on the past days when I had only studied without any goals. Then, I started writing down the dreams I wanted to achieve one by one in my notebook. These dreams are written in various ways, ranging from small dreams such as volunteering for my neighbors in need, traveling alone, traveling the bicycle country, to the long-term dream of living around the world, and preparing a house in Seoul. These dreams are the driving force for me to live passionately. I gain confidence that I can do it by looking at the dreams I have achieved, and I am doing a compass in my life to remind myself of my goals. Also, I think dreams always come true. Even if it is a reckless dream, I believe it will come true, and if I take one step closer to my dream, I think my dream is half-achieved, just like the saying, ""The beginning is half."" Currently, my dream is to join Dow Technology. As an intern at Dow Technology, I am confident that I will be selected as a new employee by performing a given task more passionately than anyone else. Even after joining Dow Technology, I will continue to challenge myself toward my dreams and create the best life in the best company. Please give me a chance to realize my dream. [SNS Form and Shared Growth] I got to know a company called Dow Technology through my junior who experienced an internship in Dow Technology QA department. I heard that it is a solid company with diverse and stable business models in the Internet service field. I did not know much about it because there are more businesses targeting B2B than B2C, but I found out that the services I have actually used such as UNICRO and payment agency are those provided by Dow Technology. I want to join Dow Technology and work on SNS Form development. I think it is a service that understands the needs of customers well with the catchphrase 'Anyone can easily and conveniently use SNS shopping platform'.In an era when the boundaries between sellers and buyers are blurred and anyone can become a seller, I think easy and fast social platforms are attractive services to individual customers. I will become a new employee who is growing up with SNS Form by participating in the SNS activation contest of shopping mall A, listening to customers and drawing out needs, and using my experience in payment-related projects in the process of converging financial services."
"1. While taking object-oriented programming A+ and programming classes, I became interested in WEP/APP development as I realized that the process of making and modifying programs is similar to the process of solving math problems that I have liked since I was young. 2. Database design A0, I learned how to use the language and programs needed to design the database and analyze big data. 3. I took Computer Graphics Design A0, Computer Graphics Design course, and I learned how to use Computer Graphics by creating 3D space and creating objects using OpenGL. I took the Big Data Manager course run by the Koreaoo Association to design databases such as Java, Oracle, Hadoop, and R, and learned the language and how to use the programs needed to analyze big data. Also, I was not satisfied with simply taking classes, and I was able to get the experience I needed for actual use by conducting a mini-project every time I learned a program, and I am working on a graduation project to design a database related to patents and a system that searches for the desired information in them. Since NHN Entertainment is a company that provides IT services based on life and culture, I think it is most important to develop programs that many users can conveniently use. After joining the company, I will try to produce performance that satisfies users to develop programs that customers need, not simply to develop to produce results."
"After graduating from high school, I came back to prepare for college. I wanted to make up for my lack of study through an academy, but most of all, I didn't want to put a financial burden on my parents, so I had a lot of worries. I gathered a lot of information to find out that there is a system that allows me to take classes for free while working at a college academy, and after the interview, I was able to work as a work scholarship and take classes. When I think about it now, the working life of the 20-year-old re-examination academy was the first step in society. Classes that involve as few as 100 people and as many as 300 people were divided among 20 work scholars, and before the class started, 20 work such as chalking for lectures and checking the status of the microphone was done together. Particularly during the vacation period, many lectures were held, and more students than students came to take famous lectures on a regular basis. Due to the large number of lectures held, there were situations where several classrooms overlapped to prepare. However, the work scholarship students not only did their job, but also took the time to help each other to resolve the shortage of manpower, and realized that cooperation is a strong force to solve difficulties together. I was able to have valuable experiences to learn the ability to organize, to be responsible, and to cooperate while working as a student at a college for nearly a year. In order to build my competence as a developer, I have developed problem-solving and collaboration skills by efficiently utilizing the semester and vacation to engage in various activities such as competitions, participation in hackathon competitions, and overseas clubs. In particular, during the semester, I participated in software competitions every year by setting the goal of winning the award by selecting the skills and services I wanted to study and make. I achieved my goals every year and won the competition in both 2015 and 2016. While taking school class, I studied new skills on my own and worked on a project, so I was burdened with time, but I think the reason I was able to succeed was because I enjoyed it. I was able to have fun while studying the skills I wanted to use and completing the projects one by one through those skills. In addition, when I encountered difficulties in unknown errors while developing, I was able to develop my ability to solve problems by solving them by myself by searching the Internet step by step with the error door as a clue. I am confident that I was able to succeed as a synergy effect because I studied what I wanted to do and had fun in the process, not because it was mandatory. My motivation for applying for ""The Zone Bizon"" was to think that the appearance of constant challenges matched my values. In addition, I was convinced that the competencies I had prepared so far were optimized for the ERP/web development job in ""The Zone Bizon"". In order to build my competence as a developer, I have developed important collaboration skills and problem-solving skills as a developer by efficiently utilizing semesters and vacations through various activities such as external clubs, competition awards, and hackathon competitions. When I do web projects through various projects through php, jsp model 2, spring framework, I have accumulated the concepts and capabilities necessary for web projects. Currently, I am learning a sense of practice by developing a sponsor system used by universities through the spring framework, and I think the experience of the sponsor management program, which develops functions for work in the university development room, is a miniature version of ERP development. Therefore, I am confident that the process and development logic experienced while planning and developing will enable me to quickly adapt to the ERP/WEB development department and faithfully perform my duties to contribute to the project. During my college life, I participated in joint development clubs, competitions, hackathon competitions, and other projects with my colleagues. I have developed collaboration skills and problem-solving skills through various activities, such as completing the results in 3 days and 2 nights by working with first-timers right away. While working on projects with office workers and designers through the joint club, I was able to discuss ideas and learn UI/UX from the perspective of weak users by having meetings with designers. In addition, while developing with an office worker who is developing in practice, I was able to learn parts that are difficult for students to understand, such as RSS parsing and effective code laws. Currently, we are developing a system that is outsourced to a ""supporters' association management system"" and uses it immediately upon completion of development. We discussed the requirements through a month-long meeting with the staff, coordinated and documented each other, and designed the client part of the system and the database. After the database design was completed, we are completing the development by dividing the roles with the team members. I am confident that the web development department will be able to quickly adapt, faithfully fulfill its role, and contribute to the improvement of the entire ""Djohn Bizon"" and service."

I am confident that I am second to none in terms of technical skills, responsibility, and patience that a developer should have. I will make the best of my abilities and meet the expectations of NICE information and communication. Since I was young, I have been praised for having a unique idea by surprising people around me by drawing pictures of future undersea cities, food, and fashion that others have never imagined. I was interested in programming that allowed me to freely realize these unique ideas and naturally went on to major in computer engineering. In order to develop a new concept of service that others could not come up with, I tried to build up my competence as a developer by completing a number of programming expert courses at oo Academy, an educational institution for development experts as well as majoring in university. As the first step in surprising the world with unique ideas, I founded a fashion shopping mall called 'OO' a year ago. We tried to provide the trust and convenience of customers through the operation method called 'pre-check payment after payment', which is differentiated from the existing shopping mall called 'pre-check after payment'. In addition, through the concept of providing personalized styling services, we tried to be competitive with existing shopping malls and targeted niche markets by targeting men rather than women as our main customer base. Naturally, this became the first opportunity in the shopping mall industry to realize individualized O2O styling services for men, and returns and refunds have occurred at an average rate of 4% lower than competitors. Based on these results, we were able to get an opportunity to be selected as a nurturing start-up for SK Planet.However, despite these achievements, I encountered unexpected difficulties while developing the service due to the disadvantage of trying to solve any problem alone. During the implementation of the payment system, the PHP-based code sample and manual provided by the payment PG company were very different from the server platform Node.js, which I implemented, which was difficult to implement. I tried to search for PHP programming books and the Internet, but I wasted five days. Eventually, I asked the payment PG for help, and I felt a great sense of despondency when I learned that it was a problem that could be solved simply in a day. As a result, when a problem arises, I try to solve it quickly by approaching anyone first, asking them, and learning. Although there were many difficulties while developing the service due to its shortcomings, the responsibility of being 'the owner of the service is me' was the driving force that led to the commercialization of the shopping mall service. It was not easy to develop the service's front/back-end alone because I was the only developer in a start-up team composed of various majors. However, this start-up started with my idea, and after staying up all night in the office for three months with a sense of responsibility that no one else could take charge of development, I was able to implement and commercialize the service within the target period. Through the start-up of a fashion shopping mall, I practiced 'passion' and 'challenge' by creating the first male personal styling service that was not found in existing shopping malls, and I decided that the 'professionalism' of running out of school to develop a solid service and entering a development professional education institution directly matched NICE's talent image and applied."
"I think there is a great potential for the development of financial it. Recently, the domestic financial industry has eased a lot of regulations on it, but it is being incorporated in various ways. So I thought that the job of financial it has a great potential for development and I will be able to expand my capabilities. The new future of financial it, which is the vision of Lotte Capital, is the same as the dream I want to achieve in my job. Lotte Capital's goal is to develop new and diverse financial products using information and communication technology to meet the diverse needs of consumers, thereby enhancing the benefits of society as a whole, and I applied to Lotte Capital because I thought it would be great if I could demonstrate my capabilities and support them. I will try to exert a higher synergy effect by adding Lotte Capital's capabilities, such as segmented financial products and leased products, and my capabilities in business administration/it. I am a person who is responsible for the results. My father worked abroad for about 10 years from my elementary school to high school. My father worked for a construction company and worked in the Middle East. After entering high school, I began to study far away. Then, while I was video chatting with my father during my second year of high school summer vacation, he said, ""I believe in you. I was able to work with my family because I believed in you. He said, ""Don't trust me in the future."" I shed tears. Since then, I have decided to change and actually acted. I thought I should take responsibility for what I am doing. However, I lacked the basics and I spent a year re-offending life after I was a high school senior. There is something I gained by successfully spending that year. It is self-control. I studied according to the set rules every day for a year. It was very difficult to study a set time and a set amount every day. But I thought it was a promise to myself and studied hard for a year. So I think I gained high self-control through re-examination. I have developed a strong mental strength to overcome long project tasks or intense tasks in my job at Lotte Capital it. [Eye-level Education] I was able to learn how to think from the other person's point of view when I provide after-school educational services to children in need at home. Children who have difficulty at home cannot go to private academies, so they receive after-school education at social welfare centers run by local governments or volunteer organizations. I did educational services to children in elementary and middle schools during the vacation at Yeonmu Welfare Center and Seongmin Social Welfare Center. When I first met them, they were very wary of me. So I asked my teacher how I could make friends with them. She said I should look at them from their perspective. In the next volunteer class, I brought chocolates, gave them a quiz, and gave them a gift. After doing this, the children approached me without hesitation. Through this experience, I realized that when I treat children, I have to look at them from their perspective. When I tried to teach them right away because I went to educational service, they felt burdened. First of all, I needed time to get close to my children, and in order to get close, I had to think from their perspective. Through this process, I think the same is true when dealing with customers. I think the process of thinking about what convenience and benefits will be from the customer's point of view is an essential process to perform an IT job. First, I studied the web, Java, and DB while working on a shopping mall production project using JSP and MYSQL, who have accumulated sufficient capabilities. In this process, I was able to learn password encryption and error page processing that I did not know in the past, and I studied how several pages were organically combined. Second, a steady researcher completed the course of oracle database sql/workshop1/2 over a month in February 2016, and studied the architecture of db and various memories in oracle db for efficiently constructing sql. In addition, during the weekend of March and June, I completed a curriculum called analyzing security weaknesses through mock hacking, and used linux to penetrate the server and analyze which part was vulnerable. Even after graduating from school, I am constantly developing myself and building up my capabilities. I have the advantage of being able to understand the other person's intentions well. At the time of the scout intern, I was asked to do short research in a short time. Although I did not have enough time, I set my own standards and researched them according to my priorities. Through this experience, I will find and deal with tasks with them first among many tasks with a high priority. On the other hand, my weakness is the lack of efficient time distribution for multiple tasks. I learned this at university and after that, I put a time limit on one task. So, when there is a set time, I perform other tasks to prevent myself from being overly immersed in one task. These efforts have led to fewer mistakes even when I have to handle tasks at the same time. First of all, in the beginning of the job, I will finish studying information security that I am currently studying, and after that, I will figure out the work and think about how to melt what I learned in the department class and what I learned in external education into my work. In dealing with future tasks, I will not only study programming languages but also create experiences in the business together. This is because it is difficult to pursue efficiency if you do not know how other departments' tasks are handled due to the nature of financial it. In addition, in the it sector, which has up to it 4 teams, we will actively interact with other teams to promote unity of the it team, and through the synergy effect, higher work efficiency and information sharing are possible. The it job always has to think about optimal efficiency and how to reduce cost and time in the process. I think that in order to achieve this, the it team should have more information about other departments and also more information sharing between the it team."
"The person who made the biggest difference in my life is my father. My father worked abroad for about 10 years from my elementary school to high school. My father worked for a construction company and worked in the Middle East. After entering high school, I started to keep away from studying. Then, while I was video chatting with my father during my second year of high school summer vacation, my father said, ""I trust you. I have been able to work with my family because I believe in you. I told him not to trust him in the future."" I shed tears. Since then, I have decided to change and actually acted. Since then, I have tried not to break promises with others and myself. Not only am I not late for the appointment with my friends, but I also focused on completing the study time I set myself. As a result, I succeeded in my re-examination and I was able to grow into a responsible person who gives trust to others. I think securities are the flower of the economy. I think all kinds of elements of the economy come together to form a stock market, and stocks come together to form a stock market. The first reason I became interested in securities was after learning about option investment in one of my major classes. I became more interested in securities by making a simulation investment that created synthetic options. I will figure out my work and think about how I can incorporate what I learned in my department class and what I learned in external education into my work. In dealing with future tasks, I will not only study programming languages but also have experience in business together. This is because it is difficult to pursue efficiency if you do not know how other departments' work is handled due to the nature of finance it. Based on these efforts, I will maximize the synergy effect of the it team in 10 years to make Shinyoung Securities a leader in the finance it world. I have the experience of overcoming crises with my active attitude. When I was in college, I worked as a group supporter. One of the supporters' activities was to distribute wet wipes and fans only to citizens who took the quiz. However, the planned day was so hot that citizens were not interested in us. The team members' motivation also declined. So I came up with an idea by taking the lead in order to increase the team members' motivation and successfully finish the mission. They didn't give us a gift when we got the quiz right, but they made some changes by giving us a gift first and giving a quiz. The citizens who received the gift didn't turn away from us. In just one hour, we filled out all the number of quizzes we wanted. I took the lead in solving the team's problems and encouraged my team members by offering opinions. Throughout my life, I have found that giving active opinions on something can be a clue to a solution, even if it is not the perfect answer. My outlook on life is 'Let's live a life looking around.' I had this outlook on life because of my experience living in the country. I went to elementary school in the country, and the most memorable teacher was the teacher who was in charge when I was in the fourth grade. Knowing that my father was on a long business trip abroad at the time, the teacher treated me like he was, and I was able to listen to him and build my self-reliance. Although I lost contact now, at that time, I thought that when I grew up, I wanted to help children like you. So I joined a university and spent my vacation doing volunteer work. I have experience in volunteer work while teaching elementary and middle school students at Seongmin Social Welfare Center and Yeonmu Welfare Center. I enjoyed the time to meet with children while volunteering, and I was even more happy if the children understood the concept properly. Through volunteer work, I raised my self-esteem and became more responsible in my life. I remember playing the role of PM in designing the project the most. I have experience in carrying out a parking lot management project in my major class, System Analysis and Design. I designed scenarios for each process and carefully analyzed how the system was executed. The biggest difficulty in the project was the difficulty in communicating between team members. For example, everyone agreed on the opinion of A, but it turned out that team members knew A as A+ or A-, not A. As this happened repeatedly, confusion occurred among team members. So I later created a terminology summary file to prevent confusion in the project. Through this experience, I learned that even colleagues who are handling the same task may have different views. Based on this, if I work on a project at Shinyoung Securities, I will be passionate and share accurate information with my colleagues to help me with the project. The most memorable thing is that I did a shopping mall project using JSP in system design and analysis. Implementing shopping mall sites for each team was a task at the end of the semester. Our team built a web server using JSP, AJAX's jQuery, mysql, and tomcat at the time. At that time, three people divided the JSP page, script page, and dbbean page and were in charge of each other. I remember gradually completing the homepage during the semester, and when the semester was over, I was impressed with my team members when I saw that the homepage that ran properly was completed. The reason this project was most memorable was that the professor told me that our team's shopping mall was implemented the most properly. It is because the various variables and page names exchanged between pages were set up intuitively and easily recognized."
"Looking back on myself, I think I always liked learning new things. I liked sports since I was young, so I learned various sports. When I was in college, I also joined a club and worked out. In the second year, I wanted to learn a field other than my major, so I learned a job through marketing school. After learning the job, I applied it to the field and worked, and after graduation, I wanted to harmonize with my major, so I interned. There, I experienced not only the marketing work, but also the culture and social life of the company through various experiences in the field and conversations with colleagues. Finally, I did research on processing big data as the subject of the graduation project before graduation. Usually, other students proceed with the project with what they learned in their undergraduate school, such as making an application or making a web as a graduation project. However, my team member and I decided to proceed with this topic because we wanted to study big data, which is a hot issue, not what we learned in the undergraduate school. I decided to work on the project by choosing each role with my team members, but it was not something I learned in undergraduate school, so I had a hard time in the middle because of difficulties from the installation process, but I was able to overcome the difficulties thanks to the team members who asked for advice from professors and graduate school seniors, studied and researched together. My major is computer engineering, and it is a software-oriented class, so I could take a lot of SW-related classes. The SW-related subjects I took are object-oriented programming, system software, Java programming, computer graphics, high-performance computing, artificial intelligence, and database. Among them, the class I was interested in was called database application, which I learned in the 4th grade. Through that class, I was able to first encounter DB, and at the same time, I was able to help me understand the big data that was in progress as a graduation project. I was able to practice 3-4 of DB-related software, and I was able to learn how to model DB (requirement analysis, normalization, and ER diagram) by choosing one application. I think big data is the most valuable industry these days. I think the value varies greatly depending on how much data a company has and how much data it can use. Accordingly, I am confident that I will be able to become an employee that Humax expects through learning through various programming and graduation projects learned in the undergraduate school. After listening to marketing training before taking a leave of absence, I always thought, 'I want to be a creative engineer.' However, my major is computer engineering, not marketing, so I wanted to work in marketing. So, after taking a leave of absence, I started an internship in sales support and marketing at an IT solution company in 2013. When I first started working, the department in charge was newly established, so there was no framework. First of all, I thought that my understanding of the company was my top priority, so I studied IT solutions. Also, I didn't forget to read and study marketing-related books because there were many things I didn't know about the marketing field. After that, I announced the schedule through weekly meetings. I worked on revising the homepage, producing and sending eDM, producing and guiding promotions, and working on documents. I had never done anything except document work, so I studied, searched, and made it by myself. As a result, even before I finished my internship, my boss suggested me to change to a full-time job as well as raise my salary. I am a person who always tries and challenges to achieve what I want. Even after joining Humax, I will always try and challenge myself with a constant mind. Since I was young, I have been told that I am mature for my age due to my deep thought and consideration. However, I have a fiery personality when it comes to things that I don't think are right. Because of this, I misunderstand that my personality is not good, but when I look at it two or three times, everyone knows and understands the reason. However, I always try to fix it because I know that it is a bad thing to make people misunderstand. When I started interning at work after taking a leave of absence, I had weekly reports and team meetings through weekly meetings. At first, the weekly meeting was burdensome, so I summarized it briefly and proceeded quickly. However, the reason for the meeting is to share opinions with others and receive feedback from each other, so I organized the materials for the meeting the day before. And when I start working, I am doing my job as accurately and quickly as possible. I ask my seniors about things I don't know and search for materials on my own to work. Because of this reason, I think I worked full-time when I was an intern."
"The reason I applied for ""SureSoft Tech"" was that I applied in line with the values of preparing for a new leap by constantly preparing for innovation without stopping at my current position. At the same time, I was convinced that the job competencies I had accumulated in activities such as external activities, competitions, and competitions were suitable for my job. While collaborating with various people, I have been working on various projects through technologies such as php, jsp, and spring framework, and I have gained experience by solidly studying technologies and concepts. In addition, when winning the mobile application implemented using hybrid app technology at the App Competition hosted by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Food, I was proved my job competencies that I have accumulated so far. I am confident that I can contribute by quickly learning and adapting to work at ""SureSoft Tech"" through various experiences along with such consistent values. If I have a title while working after joining the company, I would like to receive a second name as ""a developer who provides stable services."" As I develop, I think it is good and important to develop a program while applying new technologies while following the flow of technology. However, the most important thing while using the program is to provide stable services to users with fewer errors, and I think the more important the service is to provide useful information to many people. Therefore, I will study the service performance necessary to develop stable services while learning and learning the work properly through the experiences and capabilities I have gained. This is because the implementation of efficient performance leads to stable services. Therefore, I deeply studied java programming through a book called ""Java Performance Tuning."" After joining the company, I will provide more convenient and stable services to customers by building up the ability for stable services by working as a SW inspection at ""Suresoft Tech,"" and I will grow up preparing for the future with ""Suresoft Tech."" After graduating from high school, I challenged the college entrance exam once again. I wanted to make up for my lack of study through the academy, but more than anything, I didn't want to put financial burden on my parents, so I had to think about many things. After gathering a lot of information, I came to understand that there is a system that allows me to take classes for free while working at a college academy, and after the interview, I was able to take classes while working as a work scholarship student. Looking back, the first step in society was working at the 20-year-old cram school. Twenty scholarships shared roles in classes where as many as 100 students and as many as 300 students participated, and before the class started, 20 students worked together on cleaning up the class, including chalking and microphone status checks. Particularly during the vacation period, many lectures were held, and more students than students came to take famous lectures on a regular basis. Due to the large number of lectures taking place, there were situations where several classrooms to prepare overlapped. However, I came to realize that cooperation is a strong force to solve difficulties together by taking the time to help each other, as well as doing what they were assigned to. I was able to learn about my ability to organize, responsibility, and cooperation while living as a student at a college academy for nearly a year. Also, I was able to realize that it depends on what kind of situation I think it is and that it can be a valuable experience depending on my actions. I am confident that I can always use this mindset to contribute to the development of the service of ""Suresoft Tech."" It is a strength of my personality to immerse myself in challenging myself until I have solved the questions. As an example, I was interested in the technologies I normally use in practice and emerging technologies, so I heard a technology called log4j while talking to an acquaintance who is working in practice. It was a technology that is used a lot in practice and is mostly used by practitioners, but it was unfamiliar at the time. After returning home, I was so curious that I couldn't fall asleep that I ended up turning on my laptop and looking for related materials. As a result of looking it up, I found out that there were a lot of materials and that it was a bug-related technology, and recently, I found out that I am using a more complementary technology called logback more. As I learned the main purpose of using the technology and the current flow of use, my curiosity was solved, but I had a desire to apply it to the project based on the data I looked up. Thus, I did not finish solving my questions but applied them to personal projects, and in the process of applying them to personal projects, I organized them once more and posted them on my blog to make sure that what I studied in the process of applying them to personal projects. I became interested in using RSS after seeing that I used a lot of RSS around me, so I did a personal project using RSS. While working on the project, there was a problem that I had no experience in spring and that RSS was unfamiliar. Since it is my first time in the case of spring, I thought it would be good to proceed based on reference materials, so I asked the professor to study the materials that the seniors conducted in class. I applied the parts that were not in the reference materials to the project by filling in the gaps by searching the Internet and referring to the information on the community site. However, in the case of RSS, it took a lot of time because it was completely unfamiliar. I also searched for RSS, and I asked my acquaintances I knew while doing external activities, but I couldn't get the answer I wanted because it was unfamiliar. However, I really wanted to solve the questions, so I kept searching and looking for it, and I found that fetching information through RSS was also a kind of parsing. I searched the Internet with the keyword parsing, and I tested it starting with html parsing. Later, I found a library called Jsoup and successfully used it to get the information I wanted through RSS and use it in the format I wanted.After importing and processing the information, I thought it would be better to summarize the article and show only the important parts, so I thought it would be better to implement and apply the paragraph summary algorithm myself. I thought about what to do with the logic of the paragraph summary algorithm, and eventually, I prioritized the paragraphs through checking the frequency and frequency of words, implemented the algorithm, and applied it to the information that was imported by parsing. Although there were several crises like this, I was able to achieve the desired results by solving them one by one. I could feel once again that if I was willing to do something that was difficult while working on the project, there must be a way. We have prepared a public data contest to take on a new challenge through the capabilities we have accumulated so far. In the process of planning, the team members thought a lot about what kind of novel service to make using public data provided by the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. While looking for good public data to use, I found public data related to livestock diseases, and I thought about how it would be possible to find animal diseases directly through the symptoms identified through the user's naked eyes. I immediately looked into whether there was a service on the subject of human diseases, but found out that there was no animal and livestock-related disease service. I immediately presented my opinions to the team members and received positive responses from other team members, so I decided to choose the core service as the subject of animal and livestock diseases. In addition, by adding a function that directly shows the nearby animal hospital and a service that informs you of the latest epidemic in real time, we launched a service called ""My Own Veterinarian"" and received the second prize in the competition. While working on several projects, I learned that the ability and knowledge to develop are important, but algorithmic thinking skills are very important. For example, if you write a code that adds up by adding 1 to 10, it is usually implemented through repetitive sentences, but if algorithmic thinking ability and experience are added, you can come up with a code that improves temporal performance by applying a method such as an equal sequence rather than a repetitive sentence. As a result, we gathered people to learn algorithms every week to achieve algorithmic consumption. Each person solves algorithm problems for a set amount of time, takes turns reviewing the code, and analyzing the other person's code. Like this, I was able to develop my thinking ability by seeing the implementation method that I could not think of when I studied alone, and I am growing more through constant meetings."
"[Turning crises into opportunities is the spirit of challenge.] After graduating from high school, I tried again for college entrance exams. I wanted to make up for my lack of study through an academy, but more than anything else, I didn't want to burden my parents financially, so I had to think about it. I wanted to make money from part-time jobs by focusing on studying as much as possible, but after gathering a lot of information, I found out that there is a system that allows me to take classes for free while working at a college academy, and I was able to take classes while working as a scholarship student after an interview. Now that I think about it, the working life of the 20-year-old re-examination academy was the first step in society. Classes that require as many as 100 students and as many as 300 students were divided into roles, and before the class started, 20 scholarships worked together to clean up the class, such as chalking and microphone status checking. Particularly during the vacation period, many lectures were held, and more students than students came to take famous lectures on a regular basis. Due to the large number of lectures held, there was a situation where several classrooms that had to be prepared overlapped. However, the labor scholarship students took the time to help each other, not only to do their job, but also to solve the shortage of manpower, and realized that cooperation is a strong force that can solve difficulties together. I had a valuable experience to learn the ability to organize, to be responsible, and to work together while I was a labor scholarship student at the college for nearly a year. [Curious, meticulous, and immersed!] It is a strength of my personality to immerse myself in challenging myself until I can solve the questions. As an example, I was interested in the skills I normally use in practice and emerging technologies, so I was told a technology called log4j while talking to an acquaintance working in practice. It was a technology that is widely used in practice and used by practitioners, but it was unfamiliar at the time. After returning home, I was so curious that I couldn't sleep, so I turned on my laptop and looked for related materials. As a result of looking it up, I found out that there were a lot of materials and that it was a bug-related technology, and recently, I found out that I am using a more complementary technology called logback more. As I learned the main purpose of using technology and the current flow of use, my curiosity was solved, but I had a desire to apply it to a project based on the data I looked for. Thus, I did not end up solving my curiosity, but applied it to my personal project, and in the process of applying it to my personal project, I organized it one more time and posted it on my blog to make sure that what I had studied was my own, and then fell asleep. The downside is that focusing on one thing takes precedence in everything. In order to compensate for my shortcomings, I am making my shortcomings a strength by prioritizing whether there is anything more important before I start and putting them into action. Along with thorough management to check the priorities of work, I will focus on ideas and recent technologies that can improve the service of the ""Hankook Ilbo"" to prepare for the future and use them to grow together. [Best friends to match the ""Hankook Ilbo""!] Satisfied with its current position, the ""Hankook Ilbo"" has provided services to customers with a clear direction and goal and has developed without stopping. As such, we have supported the values that we challenge with sustainable growth and the mindset for our customers. In the Hankook Ilbo, I have accumulated the necessary job competencies as an IT developer through various activities such as external activities, contests, and contests. Through various technologies such as php, jsp, and spring framework with various people such as office workers, designers, planners, etc., I was able to develop my problem-solving skills and collaboration skills. In addition, I have gained experience by studying the technologies and concepts necessary for web development by intensively working on web projects. In addition, I studied hybrid app technology and received the award by opening my own veterinarian service by challenging at an app competition hosted by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Food. I am confident that these accumulated job competencies can be used to quickly build small-scale mobile services through hybrid apps, and that I can contribute to providing quick and stable services to customers through the development and development of web services. [Developer who provides stable web services!] After deciding on a career path, I have developed the concept and development ability of the web by focusing on web projects through various activities and challenges such as development clubs, contests, and competitions. That's why I am confident that I will be able to display my skills even more when I work on web development. If I join the Hankook Ilbo and develop a service in charge of web development, I will become a developer who provides stable service to customers. While developing, it is important to follow the flow of technology while applying new technologies, but I think the most important thing is to provide stable service to users with fewer errors. Therefore, I will focus on studying and developing the service performance necessary to develop stable service while learning and learning the work correctly through the accumulated experience and capabilities. This is because the implementation of efficient performance leads to stable service. Therefore, I even studied Java programming deeply by myself through a book called ""Java Performance Tuning."" After joining the company, I will provide more convenient and stable service to customers through my immersion in technology for stable service, and I will prepare and grow for the future with the Hankook Ilbo. [Algebraic Consumption!] While working on the project, I learned that the ability and knowledge to develop are important, but algorithmic thinking ability is very important. For example, if you write a code that adds 1 to 10 to obtain a sum, you usually use repetitions, but if algorithmic thinking and experience are added, you can come up with a code that improves temporal performance by applying an equi-order sequence rather than repetitions. As a result, we gathered people to create our own algorithmic consumption and conducted algorithm learning every week.Each of them is studying while analyzing the other's code while taking turns reviewing the code after solving algorithm problems for a set amount of time. As such, I was able to develop my thinking ability by seeing the implementation method that I couldn't think of when studying alone, and I am growing more through constant meetings."
"[Choice and concentration] My first choice is to have various part-time job experiences such as cafes, movie theaters, pubs, and office assistants. There were times when I felt physically and mentally difficult while studying and economic activities at the same time, but I faithfully performed it with a sense of responsibility for my work. Because of this sense of responsibility, I have been steadily doing what I started once by building trust for more than six months. Especially when I was working part-time at a movie theater, I actively welcomed customers thinking about what kind of service I wanted to receive from the customer's point of view, and I got the unexpected result of ""being kind and smiling."" The second choice and concentration was studying. In fact, even until the second year, after spending time due to vague about career path, I started to pay attention to web development-related fields in the second half of the second year. I focused on my studies, feeling that I lacked basic skills, but there were limitations. However, as I came to think about ways to improve my practical skills without giving up, I was able to broaden my experience through activities of the joint development club, and I have developed collaboration skills and problem-solving skills that are important to developers by using competitions and blogs. As a result, I was able to raise my GPA from 3.0 to 3.41, and I was able to develop not only my academic performance but also my competency required for my work. As such, the sense of accomplishment gained through the goals established through the selection and concentration was a valuable experience that could not be exchanged for anything else. I am sure that such selection and concentration will show efficient and successful results by focusing on the task assigned to the ""Simplex Internet."" [What turns a crisis into an opportunity is the spirit of challenge.] After graduating from high school, I decided to retake the class. I wanted to make up for my lack of study through an academy, but more than anything else, I didn't want to put financial burden on my parents, so I had to think about it. As I wanted to earn money by focusing on studying as much as possible, I learned that there is a system that allows me to take classes for free while working at a college, and after an interview, I was able to take classes while working as a scholarship student. Now that I think about it, working at the 20-year-old cram school was the first step in society. Twenty scholarship students shared roles in classes with as few as 100 students and as many as 300 students, and before the class started, they worked together on cleaning up the lecture's chalk and microphone status. Particularly during the vacation, many lectures were held, and more students than students usually came to take famous lectures. Due to the large number of lectures held, there was a situation where several classrooms to prepare overlapped. However, the scholarship students took the time to help each other, not just do their job, but took the time to resolve the shortage of manpower, and realized that cooperation is a strong force to solve difficulties together. While I was working as a student at a college for nearly a year, I had a valuable experience to learn about organizing skills, responsibility, and cooperation. I am confident that the organizing ability, responsibility, and cooperation learned through the growth process must strengthen the bond between the ""Simplex Internet"" and create synergy to increase work efficiency and contribute to it. The strength of my personality is that I am responsible for what I decide. After entering university, I became the first-year representative of the department. While playing a public role, I personally wanted to help my classmates. As I was taking the class, I found that my classmates, who entered the required liberal arts course called ""college mathematics"" from liberal arts in high school, had difficulty keeping up with the class. I started to post the solutions on the cafe by solving the materials and problems that I had organized every week, and I posted and shared the organized materials for friends in need to refer to them by setting a period and time. It wasn't easy because it wasn't a one-time event, but I exchanged information through the cafe without missing out, and I received a ""thank you"" from my friends who helped me. On the other hand, I was told that I was sad that I was neglected by meetings with my friends due to my strong responsibility for work. I tried to make a habit of taking notes carefully on my calendar and notepad in order to overcome the part of neglecting other tasks when I started working and was immersed in it, so that I could pay attention to the details. In addition, I communicated by saying the circumstances in which I was neglected by my friends, and I contacted my friends first to actively respond, so that I could solve them wisely. [You have to get together!] Until now, I have lived with the mind of ""Let's grow together while helping."" Although it may be easy to see it simply, the word ""Let's grow together while helping"" has a lot of meaning and requires a lot of effort. You need a sense of responsibility to faithfully fulfill your role through role division, and you also need to be supportive of persistence to keep responsibility. Helping others is because you need passion to help while doing your part. It takes a lot of effort like this, but it's because I have my own values that are confident that being together while helping can create synergy with each other and lead to good results. That's why even when I'm working on a team project, I've been working hard to become a person who can help by studying about the project more than others. [A challenging developer] In order to build my competence as a developer, I voluntarily participated in a development club during the vacation and carried out the project. During the semester, I tried to communicate through various experiences while challenging a software competition. Among them, I was able to improve my skills through competitions and hackathon. During the semester, we prepared for the competition held at the university under the theme of ""Web Service for Club Introduction and Support"" in groups of two. The server was developed with an MVC structure, jsp (model 2). Since I had never learned JSP and there was a fixed period for submitting results, I stayed until late at night after school class and studied the shortcomings by reading the Internet and books during the service planning to participate in the competition.I proceeded with the project with tension because I had to complete and present for three months while studying with two people. At this time, I was able to understand the concept of MVC structure and develop my ability to use Internet search. In addition, I was able to experience how the programming called Java, which I learned in school, was applied and used in the project. As a result of concentrating on it, I fell in love with it so passionately that it felt like the period was short, and I even got an unexpected award. And the sense of accomplishment came to me as a value more than effort. In addition, by participating in the hackathon held for two nights and three days, I developed the ability to quickly apply the language I studied by developing a web service that shares street performance information with developers, designers, and planners through PHP. I am sure that the ability that I have developed steadily will quickly adapt as a family to the ""Simplex Internet"" and become one and play my role as one, while at the same time being able to help others."
"[passion, curiosity, and sense of accomplishment] The reason why I want to become an S/W developer is because it burns my passion. First, the desire to conquer when a problem is difficult and the sense of accomplishment when I solve it add fuel to my passion. Especially when I implement a difficult algorithm. Sometimes there are moments when development is difficult, but each time, the desire to conquer burns up and I cannot sleep because I am curious until it is resolved. When the development is completed and the test is completed perfectly without any problems, the joy that comes from it cannot be said. I am interested in technologies and trends that I use often in practice, so I often talked about them with a friend who works in IT. One time, I heard a bug-related technology called log4j on the way home together. It is a technology that is used for sure in practice, but it was unfamiliar and I was curious at that time. I couldn't sleep because I was curious about it when I got home, so I turned on my laptop, looked for a site that had a good organization about log4j through the Internet, and the questions were solved, but as the questions were solved, I wanted to apply them to my personal projects. While searching the Internet for information necessary to apply it and applying it to personal projects, I learned the trend of using it as a secured logback in recent log4j, so I applied it as a logback, organized it on my personal blog, and fell asleep. When I have a question or a block, I find a solution, think about it, and I feel very proud. I will grow into an S/W developer by creating synergies through development that can pour oil into my sense of accomplishment and my passion and curiosity. [The moment I realized the importance of teamwork and consideration!] I carried out a study-type project for three months under the theme of ""Men's Management System,"" which targets cosmetics and perfume tastes. I thought that appearance is also competitive, so I wanted to proceed with a customized program that reflects the characteristics of men who hate complicated things. As it was my first project, I wanted to work harder than anyone else, and I wanted to be a team member who could help within the team. When we had a meeting on the ideas of the project, we actively suggested recommending cosmetics and perfumes optimized for the options set by male users according to the male management era. The team responded positively and decided on a men's care service by combining the opinion that the service should be provided with a men's barber shop. In addition, we gathered once more on a weekday other than the mandatory weekend hours to organize our mentors' contents and provide feedback time, so we presented our opinions. The team members also received this opinion positively, and our team had a team meeting time on weekdays. However, while working on a project, one of the team members suddenly went out. Since I was in the middle of a project, I was worried that there were many risks in completing the service within a fixed period of time to schedule and start again, and the atmosphere would be loosened for the team. I thought that someone should organize quickly in such a embarrassing situation, so I said I would play a role in the number of people who volunteered to leave. The increase in the role could have been a burden, but I was confident because I wanted to help my team members and prepared hard before starting full-scale development. During the development process, I borrowed books from the library for reference, but I searched the Internet for answers and asked an acquaintance who was good at development to take time for advice in person. I was able to finish it by solving these obstacles one by one and applying them to the project within a set period of time. In the end, I was able to complete a men's management web service that recommends the best product by selecting the options you want, such as price and function. [Voluntary challenge! Personal project! Summary Article Service] I was interested in using RSS after seeing that I used it a lot, so I have done a personal project using RSS. While working on the project, there were problems that I had no experience with spring and that RSS was unfamiliar. In the case of spring, since it was my first time, I thought it would be good to receive reference materials and proceed with them, so I asked the professor to study the materials that seniors had conducted in class. While looking at the reference materials, I set an overall framework, and I added functions to the framework by applying contents that are not in the reference materials through Internet search, such as sending e-mail. While working on the project, I solved the obstruction part by looking at the answers and materials left on the community site from the Internet search. However, in the case of RSS, it took a lot of time for this part because it was completely unfamiliar. I also searched for RSS through search and asked my acquaintances while doing external activities, but I couldn't get the answer I wanted because it was unfamiliar. However, I really wanted to solve the questions, so I kept searching and looked it up, and I found that fetching information through RSS was a kind of parsing. After learning that it is a kind of parsing, I looked for materials around the keyword parsing, and found out that there are many libraries for parsing. We found a library suitable for the java environment, selected and decided to use a library called Jsoup, and tested it. In the end, we succeeded in using the Jsoup library to get the information we wanted through RSS and use it in the format we wanted. After importing and processing the information, I used it from the user's point of view, and I found it uncomfortable to see some of the title and content, click on it, and go over to the article page. So I thought it would be effective to implement a paragraph summary algorithm and apply it to the content of the article so that the core content of the article can be understood only by the summary. I decided to implement a paragraph summary algorithm, and I thought about the logic of the algorithm while searching the Internet under the keyword paragraph summary.In the end, the logic of the paragraph summary was implemented so that the key paragraphs could be found by checking the frequency of the words in the article and prioritizing the paragraphs with the words with the highest frequency. Although there were several crises like this, I was able to achieve the desired results by solving them one by one. While working on this project, I could feel that passion and testing from the user's point of view are also important. Although I was unfamiliar with the technology called spring and RSS, I was able to see the earnestness and importance of the project because I focused my passion by looking for and asking questions about the parts that were blocked or incomprehensible during development until it was resolved. When I thought about the parts that I did not know at the time of development from the user's point of view, I was able to find a complement to the paragraph summary, and while developing, I was able to feel that the attitude of developing by considering both sides is important. This project is the result of these two things. As such, I will keep in mind what I felt this time and will not forget it."
"I am a person who is responsible for the results. My father worked abroad for about 10 years from my elementary school to high school. My father worked for a construction company and worked in the Middle East. After entering high school, I started to keep away from studying. Then, while I was video chatting with my father during my second year of high school summer vacation, my father said, ""I trust you. I have been able to work with my family because I believe in you."" He said, ""I will not trust you in the future."" I shed tears. Since then, I have decided to change and actually acted. I thought I should take responsibility for what I am doing. I am a talented person who can communicate with others. I have experience in volunteering at Seongmin Social Welfare Center and Yeongmu Welfare Center, teaching and teaching children of elementary and middle school students. The reason I started volunteering was because I left elementary school in the countryside when I was a child, so I lacked a way to contact better learning. So, I thought of volunteering and volunteering to serve children who are in need at home. The time I spent with children was fun, and I was even more happy if they understood the concept properly. Through volunteer activities, I have grown into a talented person who can increase my self-esteem, look around, and communicate with others. My weakness is that I am too immersed in one task. When I am immersed in one thing, I have a bad habit of holding it until I completely finish it. I had no problem until high school, but when I entered university, I had several assignments, so I needed to adjust my time. As I worked on one task for a long time, I neglected another task, and my overall score eventually decreased. So I set my own standards. I set a time limit for one task. I allocated time according to the importance of the subject, and when the time was limited, I finished the task I was doing once and moved on to the next task. As I have made a habit of controlling time like this, I am no longer busy with assignments. Since then, whatever I do, I set a time and use my time efficiently. With this experience, when dealing with IT tasks in SFA, I will prioritize tasks and efficiently handle tasks with high importance. First of all, I will figure out my work at the beginning of my job and think about how I can incorporate what I learned in the department class and what I learned in external education into my work. In dealing with future work, I will not only study the language but also build experience in business together. In the future, I will try to know more deeply about the field I am in the team than anyone else. In the case of an IT job, when I make a mistake, it is bound to appear immediately. Therefore, I will know the work process I am in charge of in more detail than anyone in the company and think about which part it is more efficient to fix. In addition, I will study so that I can immediately see where it is uncomfortable when a request to modify the computer system comes from the business department that operates the actual work."
"I attended the CES (World Consumer Electronics Show) held in Las Vegas every year as a buyer and was able to experience the best technology in advance. Seeing Samsung occupying the largest booth at the CES, the world's largest electronics exhibition, I was able to feel the status of Samsung in the world. Although it is a different affiliate, I have a dream of becoming an IT person who will lead the future technology at Samsung with the goal of being myself in the world. In addition, I learned about finance through internship at a financial investment company to become a financial IT agent beyond just IT person, and realized that the basic quality of a financial IT person is to provide reliable IT services to customers. I think the most important thing after joining the company is to learn about finance. After grasping the part of my program more accurately than anyone else, I will adapt to the tools I use at the company, quickly learn the necessary qualities in the department, and grow into a convergent professional in IT and finance. From then on, I will not only provide the best financial services, but I will always be humble. I will think of my customers first, thinking that the head office, sales staff, and actual customers who use the programs I made are all my customers. As the head of the IT department of Samsung Futures within 20 years, I will achieve my dream of becoming the best financial professional in Korea through Samsung. When I was in elementary school, I saw students sitting in front of a computer and programming at a computer academy run by my father. With a combination of English and letters full of the screen, I became very curious about the actual program being executed, and the most attractive part was that I could make what I wanted. I was attracted to this and developed a vague dream of majoring in computers, and acquired an information processing technician license at the young age of 5th grade in elementary school. After that, I went to college with only a vague dream and just didn't know what to do. At this time, what came to mind was the lesson of my alma mater, 'If you want to grow up, serve others'. I decided to immediately put what came to mind into practice. First, I sat in the front row serving the professor in the classroom, asked questions actively, participated in the class, and served the professor in my heart. As the content that I didn't understand at all gradually caught my head and eyes, I was able to proceed with undergraduate assignments and projects by myself. In addition, as I was actively serving not only the professor but also the seniors, I found myself developing my self outside of study. Only then did I understand the lessons of my alma mater, and from then on, it became my values. Since then, if I have a new beginning, I am learning with a low attitude without being proud even if I know the oldest person. I think this is the event that had the greatest impact because it is possible to overcome the difficulties of college and think about the values of my life and in the future. Even after joining Samsung Gift, I will reflect on my values and show you that I am gradually growing by serving seniors and customers from a low attitude."
"My internship at another financial investment company made me interested in financial IT. While studying finance, I learned financial-related knowledge that I had not learned as an IT person, and opened a new world. Among them, I was attracted to the securities industry by having the experience of the securities industry, the flower of the capital market, and the global economy can be encompassed beyond Korea. As a result, I set a new detailed goal of becoming a securities IT person in which the IT knowledge and the securities industry, which I learned in my undergraduate program, are combined. As I was analyzing my work to achieve my goal, I felt that the customers of the financial IT job I supported were not only actual customers but also employees who used my program. I want to provide a computer system for my employees, development and maintenance, and the web and applications for actual customers. I want to grow up to be an IT convergence expert in finance, listening to all customers saying, 'Thanks to IT support, my work has become easier!'. Aiming to become a computer expert, I have prepared two competencies. First, among the various competencies that members of IT must have, I thought that the most important was the basic competency of IT, so I wanted to have a firm domain in the major of computer. Through the undergraduate program, I took various major skills that I thought were basic, such as Database and C. Java. In addition, through the DB Employment Academy education, I completed education on Web, Java, and DB, and conducted a project called 'Between Musical and Theater' under the theme of performance reservation service. In order to confirm my knowledge of my major, I had time to review my major I learned while obtaining an information processing technician license. Second, I tried to provide high quality products through a QA (Qualification Guarantee) intern course of a company called **. Through this, I think we will be able to provide the best quality software from Hyundai Securities. We conducted QA on TrusZone, a network separation solution, and found bugs by conducting Confirm Test and Regression Test through TC for updated items. It was not just looking for bugs, but also modified and managed TC according to the changed contents, tried to develop the product, and recommended it to the staff in charge of changing the program details. In elementary school, I saw students sitting in front of a computer and programming at a computer academy run by my father. With the combination of English and letters full of the screen, I became very curious about the actual program being executed, and the most attractive part was that I could make what I wanted. I was attracted to this and had a vague dream of majoring in computers. After that, I went to college with only a vague dream, but I was just stuck in learning unfamiliar languages and theories. At this time, the word that came to mind was the lesson of my alma mater, 'If you want to grow up, serve others'. I decided to immediately put what came to mind. First, I sat at the front in the classroom, actively asked questions, participated, and served the professor in my heart. As the content that I had no understanding caught my head and eyes, I was able to proceed with undergraduate assignments or projects. As I served not only the professor but also the seniors actively, I found myself developing an ego outside of study. It was only when I understood the lessons of my alma mater, which I had never understood in high school, and from then on, I became my values. After that, I am learning with a low attitude while serving a large person. Even after joining Hyundai Securities, I will reflect on my values and show you how I will develop gradually and become a big person by serving my seniors and customers from a low attitude. It is said that when wolves find the prey they are aiming for, they bite and stretch until the end until they die. So, when I set a goal that I want to achieve with the wolf, I try to keep it patiently. That is why I patiently kept the things I set once. My undergraduate life goal is not to be late or absent, and to complete 100% of the assignment. I lived with the conviction to keep even two basic things. However, when the JAVA final project came out, it was not easy to stay late after staying up all night to complete it. Nevertheless, with my strong mental strength, I had never been late or absent during my undergraduate life, and I also completed 100% of the file-processing final project at that time in addition to the JAVA project. As such, persistence is the driving force behind burning passion. On the other hand, the disadvantage is that I am impatient. In order to compensate for my impatience in my daily life, I often take deep breaths and use a diary to prioritize and practice it. Since the trust given to customers in the financial industry is directly related to the number of customers, we must make ceaseless efforts to build trust. Based on that trust, Hyundai Securities is currently the leading securities company in Korea, but I think we can leap to become the best securities company that provides various high-tech financial services to customers only when we build more trust. In the IT field, we don't give that trust directly. However, I think we can build trust indirectly to people by providing good services such as web pages, mobile devices, and HTS. I want to become an IT employee who indirectly builds trust in Hyundai Securities. After joining the company, I will quickly learn the necessary qualities in the department in charge, such as accurate grasp of the program I am in charge of and acquire financial knowledge, and grow into an IT finance expert to provide services suitable for Hyundai Securities. In addition, by steadily understanding the IT technology trends, we will strive for better IT services by incorporating new technologies into existing IT services. And as the head of Hyundai Securities' IT division within 20 years, I will achieve my dream of becoming the best financial computer in Korea."
"Life is not about living alone. It's about living together. No matter how good each person is, they end up helping each other. I have always wanted to be helpful to others. I also wanted to get help when needed. In college, I prepared for the International Programming Contest (ACM-ICPC) to understand algorithms in addition to studying my major. I participated periodically in the department meeting. We each presented a theme. They said they wanted to do a singing part that they were confident in and helped them understand easily. I also participated in the competition and worked as a group for several hours to solve problems. I worked as a work scholarship student at the IT help desk, an on-campus computer center. I got a call from the finance department and asked to set up my printer. While I was working, I got a call from another department. He said that the PC often stopped because of the blue screen. He asked his colleague to messenger to check the ram short and ask for help to remove dust from the computer fan. After I finished my work, I thanked him and bought him a bottle of drink. We would like to create all kinds of infrastructure for smart school construction in the Middle East and Asia other than Uzbekistan. Since the domestic IT infrastructure market is already saturated, we have to look abroad. In the early days, there was a lack of understanding of human resources and the local situation, but now we have overcome the difficulties. It is time to put more and more development manpower into it. Unlike other companies, LG Ensys has servers from various vendors such as IBM, Oracle, and EMC. I would like to build a system as the main body, not just to be ordered to do it. Through the establishment of a system, I want to contribute to the development of my capabilities in a small way and the growth of the company in a large way. When developing, I always develop it with the customer's details in mind. During the software engineering team project in the second semester of the third year, I developed a restaurant service. In charge of DB, I first created the main menu table after creating the user and operator tables necessary for the login process. I thought about how to allow people to change not only the main menu but also the side menu to suit their taste, and I made an ingredient table according to the menu. In addition, we tried to provide user convenience by creating a history table for order records and displaying a recommended menu. After being discharged from the military, I went to an IT academy while studying in the department. I studied basic knowledge such as C, Java, JSP, and Linux in the network comprehensive class and have experience in building a network virtually using GNS3 and packet tracer. I set up routers and switches, assigned IPs, and then tried static and dynamic routing. It is a virtue that a system engineer should have that there is no restriction on the approach. We developed a remote window control app using Android and Raspberry Pi. The goal was to control two windows individually. In general, the client-server method is a method where there is one server and several clients connect in it. I tried to program it as shown in the book. When I set the settings and pressed the apply button, two windows worked at the same time. After thinking about it for three days, I reversed my thoughts. This was the way multiple servers (Pi) connect to one client (app). During the login process, several ports were connected to one ip using the internetSocketAddress (ip, port) function, and whenever data exchange was needed, the socket was made into a thread and opened and closed, and it was finally solved. Develop it with grit to improve it."
"[Uniforms] I think uniforms with a sense of belonging in group life are words that can express myself. For example, as many students took autonomous classes after entering college, they lived more personal lives than in groups. However, the motivation I made during my college life was to entertain both my seniors and my colleagues. Seeing this, I thought that my friend's interpersonal skills were something to learn from my group life. I also made a commitment to become a person who is necessary and has a presence for people in my group life. First of all, I tried to follow that motivation and learn how to deal with people. Furthermore, in order to meet more people, I joined two Somoim in the computer department and participated actively. Through Somoim's positions, I was able to develop my own communication skills. Through consensus, I learned how to make friends with people I met for the first time, and I recommended expressing my opinions to my passive friends. Over time, I got interesting nicknames like the 'King of Sagan' and the 'King of Inmaek.' Also, I still receive advice from the seniors I made at the university, give counseling to the juniors, and maintain a positive relationship. I am sure that the smooth communication method and interpersonal skills that I have learned will be a member of the KB Data System and show them positively in practice. [Customer-centered IT] What I felt in my college life is that among the many technological fields, the part where people can directly experience technological changes is SW. For example, with the advent of smartphones, the number of telebanking users has decreased and the number of financial services users through smartphone applications has increased. In addition, as I proceeded with the project, I learned that SW can provide convenient services to users with the emergence of new technologies. As such, it allowed me to have customer-centered thinking in college life. KB Data System provides customers with convenience in financial use through banking system, financial institution business system, and financial institution business support system. As such, I think financial IT business is to develop a system that can provide convenience for financial transactions to customers. Also, KB Financial Group is taking on a new challenge of being an Internet-only bank for customers. I think KB Data System, an IT partner of KB Financial Group, will also participate in this challenge. With the customer-oriented thoughts I felt in college life, I wanted to become a new employee who contributes to the growth of the KB Data System, so I applied without hesitation. [Posture after joining the company] I will be a helpful member of the KB Data System. First, after joining the company, I will try to become a true member of the KB Data System. First of all, I will have pride and affection for the company, follow the seniors like shadows, imitate their work skills and attitudes, and make them my own. The reason why the KB Data System was able to come to the current position is that I think it was possible because of the seniors who are now. Second, I will become a member who continues to study to become a recognized SW developer in the KB Data System. This is because I think that major knowledge and work ability for a SW developer is competitiveness. Based on these knowledge, I will actively participate in practical work. Finally, I will have an attitude to conceive about customer-oriented SW without missing new technologies. This is because I think I can provide convenient services to customers through new technologies. In order to lead customer-oriented services, I will pay attention to the emergence of new technologies and come up with a plan for the convergent outcome of financial IT. With this attitude, I will become a new employee '***' who contributes to the growth of the KB Data system. I think teamwork and passion are important factors in practical projects. [Teamwork: FreeRider as a companion] There are students who are free-riding during university group projects. I also have experience facing this situation in a team project at a university. I thought teamwork was important when I was working on a 20** team project, so I held two meetings a week. However, I had a problem in the team meeting, which I thought would be easy. As the meeting progressed, one of the team members began to show an appearance of a freerider who did not perform his or her role. Eventually, there was a setback in the progress of the project, so the rest of the team members, including me, took the role of the freerider instead, and all of them began to complain about the uncooperative attitude. Rather than excluding the team members in this matter, I thought about how I could complete the project together as a team. In order to solve this problem, we decided to have time to communicate with the team members in question. Because I thought that conversation was the only way to solve the heavy team atmosphere. One day, we had a company dinner time and talked about everyday things such as our team members' interests and hobbies. The friend opened his mind and shared his concerns in a comfortable atmosphere. He said that he couldn't understand the contents of the meeting due to the inconvenience caused by the age difference and the lack of technology on the topic he was developing for the first time. It wasn't just this team member's fault that the participation rate decreased. I thought that there were also problems that the team was not interested in the team members. This led me to learn about the importance of communication in the team project. In addition, I had time to communicate with the team members twice a month, and I was able to complete the project within the period through feedback among the team members. In the practical project, I think teamwork among the team members will be more important. Based on this experience, I will contribute my teamwork ability when I proceed with the practical project of KB Data System. [passionate attitude toward goals] In the 20*** Creative Engineering Design course, we have conducted a Smart RC Car project that can express smart cars to come. We developed RC Car remote control and automatic parallel parking functions through a smartphone app. Despite the complete implementation of all the functions, we did not win in the undergraduate contest.I challenged the project once more with the theme of RC Car. This time, computer science students started with the goal of winning the Capstone Design Competition, in which all engineering students in the university participate, not competitors. I came up with an idea for a project that provides driving practice using a car to users in real-world situations, not games, and I started actively recruiting team members to achieve my goal. It was divided into two parts: the video receiving part of a smartphone to be installed in a VR device, and the development of a handle and a pedal that control the RC Car. I was in charge of controlling the direction of the IP Camera using a gyro sensor of the smartphone and the real-time video receiving of the smartphone. The IP Camera control was implemented using four-way buttons mounted on the console handle. In the video streaming part, it was implemented using Thread to provide users with two images to be shown to VR devices in one IP Camera. At the Capstone Design Competition exhibition, I was able to attract the attention of the audience and receive high praise for the judges and creativity. As a result, I won the gold prize at the exhibition and achieved my goal."
"[The beginning and experience of ERP] ** I've been a member of the software membership for nearly a year, and the interview was just around the corner. I've known a few professors since I've been working in the lab, and while I was naturally talking with them before returning to school in the fourth grade, I learned that many public enterprises that use the system and a brief explanation of the ERP system made in SAP are coming to Naju. ERP became very interested in the system after hearing that it is possible to manage the company's resources and support the work efficiently, and I heard that there is a training schedule for specific ERP experts. I quit Samsung Software Membership and started preparing to become an ERP expert in earnest, and thanks to such efforts, I was able to get a job as a computer employee of a company that uses SAP before graduating. I worked there for about a year and seven months, learned development using ABAP language, and experienced maintenance of web pages using BSP and Javascript. In the first year of SCM work, we supported the improvement of the work in the field by developing programs such as reservation of fixed vehicle information management, batch input of orders, batch change of customer information, and upload of dispatch information. We minimized the inconvenience of users through the maintenance of the year-end settlement web page and the labor cost prediction system that improved while working on personnel affairs. The labor cost prediction system requires personnel to predict labor costs for various purposes and times, including annual, quarterly, and monthly, and it has been confirmed that it takes about a week due to numerous variables. The development was successful in reducing the time required for simulation dramatically, and as a result, it showed very successful prediction accuracy. It was a successful task to design and develop a system that had been mentioned about the necessity since the introduction of SAP a long time ago and to meet the needs of users. KEPCO KDN, which is in charge of the IT-related tasks of KEPCO Group, applies electricity IT technology to the entire power system from power generation to customers by selling electricity. We are working to efficiently generate electricity and prevent electricity loss. We are working to build an efficient system by solving problems, and I think KEPCO KDN's role is to contribute to providing high-quality electricity while maintaining low cost. IT moves people and objects and helps them. My passion to become part of KEPCO KDN, the IT conductor of KEPCO Group, which connects people and objects, gave me strong motivation to apply. Also, **PNS' social contribution activities, represented by *****, show the true nature of a company with social responsibility. I believe that social contribution activities to create a better life through the meeting of nature, culture, and mankind will be a link between companies and people, making them a company that can sustainable growth. [We will develop Smart Grid that maximizes efficiency] KEPCO KDN is playing a pioneering role in the field of Smart Grid. In line with that, I will contribute to the development of programs that can help the efficient operation of Smart Grid systems within 5 years or 10 years. For one year, I will strive to become a creative and innovative talent through in-depth consideration of the policies and ideas implemented by the company, and will strive to strengthen teamwork with colleagues. In five years, I will become a professional talent and work hard to develop Smart Grid to identify and supplement the shortcomings based on various experiences. In 10 years, I will become the axis to create Smart Grid that has the characteristics of KEPCO KDN. Smart Grid is KEPCO KDN's business vision to efficiently allocate electricity due to the increase or decrease in electricity usage, to efficiently manage electricity demand, and to prepare for the future in which consumers can become producers. Among them, efficient electricity demand and management will strive to present and develop directions for development by utilizing the experience of improving performance through efficient energy use that I have researched. I will do my best to make the future of the company more special and to establish myself as a leader in the same industry. [Easy road vs. difficult road vs. old method vs. new method] It happened during the military service. I had to manage more than 20 vehicles, including 12 successors who were dispatched to other companies as a driver and a broken car. I was a year apart from my immediate successor, and I was forced to serve as a short squad leader for three months when about half of the cars were unable to move. I was in a situation where I only had to take good care of myself and be discharged from the military because my military life was just around the corner. However, because my successors were struggling in a bad situation, I immediately started to think about whether to choose an easy path for three months as a good older brother or a difficult path to struggle first for the upcoming crisis. The bottom line was that I chose a difficult path for the future. Another problem was the conventional maintenance method. The conventional maintenance method was a natural way for the car owner to manage. However, it did not work properly because there were a lot of vehicles and insufficient personnel, and there were not enough people who knew how to perform the maintenance. I started to approach it in a different way. Regardless of the vehicle owner, I wrote the types that needed to be repaired every day and assigned inexperienced personnel for each type of maintenance. The problem was that it was not my own vehicle maintenance, so when a problem occurred, it could lead to a difficult situation, but I decided to endure that. In the case of receiving accessories, it was difficult for successors to receive them, so they received requests for necessary parts every evening and delivered them to them the next day. Thanks to our hard work, we were able to start all vehicles. We were able to receive a reward leave from the company commander of the dispatch unit. I will become a talented person of KEPCO KDN who creates results in a creative way with a sense of responsibility that is ""us"", not ""me"". [The power of efficiency] What made me interested in ERP was that I did research when I was a university student to increase the efficiency of protocols with limited energy, and I confirmed that there was a breakthrough performance difference.I experienced the power of efficiency to make such a difference under the same conditions, and I was interested to hear that the ERP system is a system that operates the company's resources efficiently. I have a lot of interest and interest in what it would be like to effectively improve the inventory management of products or the flow of products produced, and I have seen the efforts of practitioners to solve this situation from the side and know that it is possible. I will become a talented person who makes continuous efforts to design and develop an efficient system through these direct and indirect experiences. [Prepared ERP Expert] I want to join KEPCO KDN and become a competent ERP expert. In order to become an ERP expert, I obtained SAP ABAP developer certificate and OCP 10G certificate. I also want to be a member of a place that can impress users in the IT field that can identify and meet their needs while impressing them. In addition, I would like to be reborn as an expert who researches and develops directions to develop systems that share and progress tasks in one space into more humane and efficient systems. As a supporting company of the Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO) which is the base business of the Republic of Korea, I have a lot of interest and interest in what it would be like to effectively improve the flow of the entire power system process, production, distribution, and sales process by grasping the characteristics of the power industry. I have seen from the experience of the manufacturer that working-level officials' efforts to solve this situation have been made, and I know that it is possible. I will become a talented person who makes continuous efforts to design and develop an efficient system through these direct and indirect experiences. [Individual ethics is the discipline of the company] KEPCO KDN is in charge of overall IT as it supports KEPCO, which is the base industry of the Republic of Korea. For this reason, KDN is believed to be closely connected to many companies and has a very important symbiotic relationship with a partner who understands the characteristics of the power company. I think that relationships with these characteristics will often have difficulties. The company thinks that it is a place where a lot of talented people gather to do one thing. However, company rules exist because not everyone's thoughts and actions can be the same. All employees of a company must follow the rules of the company. Regardless of the company's personal life, I believe that the most important part of everything is to keep the basics and the foundations, and everything starts with a sense of ethics. Ethical consciousness creates standards for making correct decisions under any circumstances, and it cannot be guaranteed that a person who lacks ethical consciousness follows the company's rules well. KEPCO KDN is a member of Korea's representative group company and has connections with many external companies. As such, many moments of temptation will come to each individual. The fact that each individual's ethical consciousness is not firmly maintained is also related to the company's rules and will lead to the loss of the trust of the Korean people, which will soon be a big problem for the company's future. As a representative company in the country, I think that being better at ethical standards and discipline than anyone else is the basic knowledge of employees in public institutions."
"Due to the influence of my bright and positive parents, I have an open mind that is bright, positive, and respect diversity everywhere. I am open to and accept any possibilities. I am a constant person who continues to challenge myself with the idea that such positive energy affects others around me and that I can do it even in difficult situations. Also, I consider relationships to be the most important thing in society, so I treat people with respect and consideration. Therefore, I have a good relationship and am responsible for everything given to me and finish meticulously. In order to make up for the slow work due to my meticulous personality, I can find my own know-how and process things accurately and quickly. The biggest weakness is not having much knowledge or experience in security, but I am confident that I can do well if I am interested and try my best as everyone does. In addition, through the enjoyment and teamwork that I value in Com2uS, I believe that I can be a multi-playable talent who can perform given tasks and furthermore, help me grow steadily, so I will continue to challenge and learn as much as possible. As I learned programming in college, I dreamed of becoming a developer. In particular, I am interested in security, and recently, I am studying theoretical while preparing for an information security driver certificate. Although I have no experience in security practice yet, I applied for game security because I thought there was a possibility of growth by constantly studying and challenging without giving up because it is a career path I wanted to challenge. In addition, I think it is a company that can lead me to demonstrate my best ability to develop and work happily with my team members by emphasizing teamwork, and above all, I applied for Com2uS because it is located in a short distance, making it easier to leave and leave work and perform work efficiently. Although not in the game security field, I have experience in coding c and c++ using visual study, and I have experience in Windows phones and mfc. In addition, I have experience of learning java, experience of making sos application with Android studio, and have experience in developing various languages and tools such as HTML and my sql. First of all, I will try to adapt quickly to the team that belongs to Com2uS, focus on work training for practical purposes, and review them repeatedly so that I can perform the given task smoothly. I will study security-related knowledge, acquire related certificates, realize that I am lacking in work, and continue to learn in an attitude of learning. In order to improve my practical skills as well as intellectual aspects, I will ask a lot of advice from my colleagues and constantly challenge myself to solve them. Also, as a global company, I will continue to prepare for studying English, foreign languages such as Chinese and Japanese, and I will develop the capabilities of global talents so that overseas work can proceed smoothly. I will continue to develop and change from an employee who can always enjoy games with a bright and positive mind, and I will also work with pleasant people at a pleasant Com2uS and create a Com2uS that extends around the world with tremendous synergy."
"""I will grow into a core talent with my strengths of consistency and communication skills."" TmaxTibero is the best database company in Korea, reflecting differentiated architecture and various functions. In addition, it succeeded in developing TAC (DB Clust Technology), which Oracle has monopolized, for the second time in the world. It is recording a steady growth rate of over 10% every year in the domestic market. In the future, development of software is important, but I think continuous management and operation through software QA service are more important. In this regard, I think the ability to communicate with customers is important. I applied to TmaxTibero because I thought I could show my strengths of consistency and communication skills well. In the short term after joining the company, I will try to strengthen my major knowledge into practical conversations, acquire knowledge and information necessary for practical use, and adapt to my work. I will act as a mid-point in managing new employees in the medium term. Based on the experiences and difficulties I experienced when I was a new employee, I will help new employees to adapt quickly to their work. In the long term, I have expertise in QA job. As such, I feel responsible for my duties, and I will thoroughly verify DBMS products, minimize bugs, and guide customers in advance about possible problems, thereby minimizing issues and making DBMS satisfied. My strength is that I never give up even though it's hard for the first time. After eight years of patiently working out at the gym more than five days a week, my body, which was nicknamed 'OO' with a small body weighing 175cm and 55kg, has been able to change into a 75kg muscle-like body. As a high school student, I was not confident due to my small body, so I recklessly started doing push-ups to change my appearance and increase my confidence. No matter how annoying and physically difficult I was, I steadily did 100 times a day for at least five days a week. After joining the military, I continued to exercise and gained strong enough physical strength to acquire a top-class warrior. After being discharged from the military, I made plans by watching exercise videos on YouTube and started working out in three parts. From the M-sized t-shirt I used to wear in high school, I now wear size XXL. I was able to realize once again the importance of the results accumulated by consistently doing seemingly trivial things every day. The downside is that I tend to be nervous in front of people. When I go on stage for an important presentation or a hall serving part-time, I get nervous, so I often can't show as much result as I've prepared. To compensate for these shortcomings, I gave presentations when doing group assignments and actively gained presentation experience in front of many students I've never seen before. Through these experiences, I was able to overcome more tension in front of the public than in the past. As for my expertise in the field of recruitment, I learned various programming languages such as C, JAVA, and PYTHON by majoring in in in information and communication engineering during my undergraduate days. In order to learn scarce knowledge such as software design, development, and maintenance, I obtained an information processing engineer license. In addition, after working at an event and a hall serving part-time for three years, when customers did not like them or suffered damage due to store negligence, I tried to provide the best service possible while communicating with customers, and my communication skills improved. In the future, I will continue to reduce tension through a lot of presentation experience and various activities with my strength of consistency. In addition, I will continue to study the knowledge and information necessary for quality control to increase my professionalism, communicate with various people, and improve my communication skills to become a talented person who grows up. ""If you do nothing, nothing happens, but if you challenge something, there is always a change."" After working as a serving part-timer at a sushi restaurant for three years, the monthly sales usually ranged from 1 million won to 2 million won on average on Sundays, Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays. On Fridays and Saturdays, it cost about 2 million won to 3 million won. However, due to COVID-19, the store's sales have been cut in half due to restrictions on the number of people and hours. The restaurants I worked in were mostly sold in halls, and deliveries averaged about five a day. When I thought about it to increase sales, I found that many students lived alone around the school. If I ordered delivery, it was too much to eat alone. I suggested to the boss that we add a single person menu to the delivery menu and add more basic side dishes that we go out together. In the case of basic side dishes, they suggested adding white kimchi, salt bridge, and ssamjang that customers visit when they visit the store, and providing two fried shrimp that customers say is delicious as a review event. In this way, we added a menu for one person, basic side dishes, and review events. As time passed, about 5 to 10 deliveries usually came in, but as 30 to 40 on weekdays and about 60 came in on weekends, it became similar to sales before COVID-19. Although net profit decreased compared to before COVID-19 due to delivery costs and ingredient prices due to additional basic side dishes and review events, sales were similar. I think sales will increase further if COVID-19 eases over time. For the Capstone design competition ""Based on cooperation and responsibility,"" we developed an attendance check program through face recognition. The reason for the development of the program is that as non-face-to-face classes are held due to COVID-19, professors and classmates feel difficult to check attendance and plan to develop it for classmates who have difficulty checking attendance properly. The program was developed by two people including me. When developing the program, I was in charge of server development and membership information registration. The team member wrote a code that compares the existing registered face with the face to be checked for attendance, and a code that sets environmental variables and detects faces. The rest of the facial recognition development was done with the team member. Our team had no experience with open cv and python, so we started to learn how faces are recognized by searching YouTube and Naver about facial recognition. When we found materials related to face recognition, we shared them and explained what we knew and didn't know.The server development was developed by using REST API method to separate the server from the local, compare it with the picture stored on the server, and if it matches, attendance verification was processed. The membership information registration was developed so that if you enter the subject and name you are taking and register a picture of your face, you can be saved in a file. The face recognition part is a program that uses open-source facenet-pytorch to be present if it matches the picture stored in the file. Since it was our first time doing this field, we were able to complete the program because we felt responsible for our duties while teaching each other what we didn't know. Even though we did not win the prize, it was a good opportunity to encounter various fields while making the program."
"I am 00th year JAVA developer 000. The back end uses Java, Spring Framework, Mybatis, and the front end uses JSP. DB uses Oracle, mysql, to develop the web, check servers, and maintain solutions. Participating in the 2nd authentication development project of OO customer, we received the 2nd authentication RESTful API design and the customer's requests, and completed the 2nd authentication development by reflecting them in the future development direction. A team of two participated as the main developer in the OO customer's system reconstruction project, designed RESTful API, distributed apps to Linux servers, and monitored services, and built and opened the system stably. As a lot of news is reported every day and fake news is being sold, there are many cases of wearing colored glasses even if it is a breaking news. Perhaps because of the increase in people like me, sites for fact-checking have begun to appear, and it would be nice if there was a service that indicates news that has been confirmed in JTBC news. For example, if a check icon indicating that you are an authenticated user on YouTube is displayed next to the ID, a check mark is placed in front of the news title to let the user know that the news is confirmed, so that users can trust the news and make JTBC more competitive by providing services differentiated from other media companies through the service"
"""Life as a computer soldier with my parents"" They have always served as guides and mentors for my life. My father, who has pride in his career, has emphasized an attitude to do his best in everything. My father's teaching allowed me to pay close attention to even the smallest things and make efforts. It influenced the formation of my values, ""Those who work hard are not allowed to do anything."" In addition, my mother, who supported me by saying, ""Can you do it until the end?"" She has developed perseverance not to give up on her task in the middle. Also, it was during the period when I worked as a computer soldier of the OO Division that I was able to change and build values in my life. Resolving network disruptions in the division was my mission and network was at the core of my military's work, so resolving them required considerable responsibility and meticulousness. Even if I was in a technical position, I was a computer soldier who worked for executives, so I could feel the importance of friendly service spirit and accurate information delivery. And it was important to be honest about what was unresolved. I've seen cases where lying because I'm afraid of being scolded can make the problem serious, so I've learned that it's important to be honest and get help from others. ""Ruling memory by record"" meticulousness. The best thing about being organized is the habit of integrating and managing notes and notes in an electronic notebook. There's a saying that goes ""record governs memory."" I think it's a really good habit to keep records of group meetings, ideas, learning, areas of interest, and everything. Using electronic notebooks, I could quickly take notes anytime, anywhere, and search for words I wanted to use the Ctrl+F key to find them all quickly and organically. If you keep doing what you can, you can't do what anyone can. This habit of organizing and trying to systematically manage the incoming knowledge will be the best help in your work. I had taken an English presentation class when I was in fourth grade. I hated the personality of not being able to speak well in front of people, so I took the class to practice English presentation in front of people before moving on to society. I also messed it up because I was nervous at the first presentation. After class, the professor said that I was originally more nervous than I was, and that practice is the only way to live. I started practicing in front of the mirror as I learned from the professor, and I was speechless imagining myself standing in front of people, but I kept practicing until the tension subsided. After practicing several times, I was able to successfully finish the final presentation and the evaluation table that the professor gave me with a smile marked perfect scores for everything. Like this experience of overcoming shortcomings, I have been living with a top priority on my growing life and am aiming for the following life. The first is a life in which I am harmonized with people. Just as meeting the professor led me in a better direction, I was able to grow in a good direction thanks to the people around me, and I think that I exist in the present. The second is a life of challenge. In order to grow, I need opportunities such as ""presentation classes,"" so I have tried to use them as a springboard for my leap forward by challenging various internal and external activities. ""Think of what to do today."" The most important thing to do every day is to wake up early in the morning and think of what to do today in advance. I can wake up early and put myself together by thinking about my daily routine. This may be trivial, but after doing the first simple task that I had planned in the morning, I felt a small sense of pride and satisfaction, giving me the courage to do the next task. After the day ended as I had planned, I was able to continue working on the next day and the next day. However, waking up early in the morning and thinking about my daily schedule is very cumbersome. If I didn't do it a day or two, it was difficult to achieve a full day and it was easy to break up until the next day. I thought that if I couldn't do such a trivial thing, I couldn't do better, so I tried to stay defiant and steady, and now I have become a habit. Even after joining OOO, the courage and satisfaction of waking up early in the morning to complete each of the tasks that I had planned will greatly help me to unleash my passion, activism, and creativity. It was time for OOO to do a team project. Our theme was 'Choosing the Best Location of a Charging Station for Hydrogen Cars.' I was making it easy to do research and find papers and data related to Hydrogen Cars, but I found an unexpected problem. Even if the location was selected in consideration of the floating population or the area where a lot of hydrogen cars were purchased, it was difficult to select the optimal location in the Seoul area because of the perception that hydrogen charging stations were hateful facilities and the safety distance from legally designated shelters. Inevitably, we were able to find the optimal location by converting an LPG charging station that had already met the safety conditions similar to a hydrogen charging station to a hydrogen charging station. If we had done this more accurately in advance, the analysis could have been done more accurately without wasting time. Although it was not solved effectively due to public awareness and safety factors, it was an experience that I could learn the importance of accurate analysis of problems at the beginning of the project. This is when I had an internship experience at an IT infrastructure company. As I was working with my colleagues on the task of installing the APM source and linking the XE with the APM source, problems occurred depending on the version. The solution to the problem depending on the version is complicated and requires an understanding of each function. A good way to solve the problem in a situation where the amount of knowledge is large and the amount of time is low, and the ability to collect information and manage the collected information systematically. I have a habit of systematically managing knowledge such as school classes and search contents by using online notes, which are usually electronic notebooks, but when I needed to know a large amount of information, electronic notebooks helped me a lot. This method helped me a lot when I was an intern. Even now, electronic notes that are systematically organized to check what I learned or materials at that time are very helpful.I entered the Department of Information and Communication Engineering, admiring the sparkling server room ""the first step toward my dream,"" but the first grade class did not have any subjects dealing with equipment that I had expected. Thus, I attended a computer academy and set a goal of becoming a computer soldier in the military in order to directly operate the network and server equipment. I studied my major fields such as network and Linux Windows in advance, and as a result, I passed the CCNA exam and applied for the computer soldier. I joined the military as a computer soldier with the goal of ""21 months of IDC life, where I was able to learn values, service spirit, and professionalism"", and I worked on network management and composition of the entire division in the 00th Division. Since network was the core of military work, resolution of disability required considerable responsibility, and since I was a computer soldier working against executives, I was able to learn the service spirit better than anyone else. Even in a technical position, I could feel with my body that it was important to deliver kind and accurate information because I had to deal with people. And it was important to be honest about what was not solved. I've seen cases where lying because I'm afraid of being scolded can make the problem serious, so I've learned that it's important to be honest and get help from colleagues. It's very important to give trust through responsibility, honesty, service spirit, and expertise in dealing with your IT infrastructure. More than anyone else in two years, these experiences have helped me learn the importance of professionalism, reliability, and customer satisfaction. ""Thinking about the value of interns and engineers"" In the military, if it was focused on network, I took training in the overall infrastructure and server field while doing internship. During the two months of internship training, I received basic Linux & Aix training, VMware, X86 server, Ansible, and storage, and for a month, I attended the training. During the training period, I visited various customer IDC and worked on basic tasks such as rack installation, server mount OS default setting, raid configuration, and dualized testing, and I tried to understand the overall flow of infrastructure by looking at the plans and network configuration diagram. In addition, I thought about where to place the value of infrastructure engineers in a situation where infrastructure is becoming clouded and virtualized. I believe that these experiences and capabilities will help you adapt to GS Neotech's cloud technology support department. I will join GS Neotech and become an employee who can give customers confidence based on my experience and expertise in infrastructure through experience in military computer soldiers and internship in IT infrastructure, which are the basic tasks of engineers."
"1) BE development 2) FE development 3) Android development computer vision / A+ / It was a useful class to learn and practice various image processing functions required for actual image processing. I was able to learn analysis techniques through data preprocessing or visualization techniques necessary for data visualization / A+ / Deep learning. I was able to learn basic concepts such as clustering and PCA, which are pattern recognition techniques based on pattern recognition / A+ / Unsupervised learning. Algorithm analysis / A+ / Programmers were able to have a solid foundation of the basics such as alignment algorithms, BFS and DFS search methods. I was able to organize the theoretical concepts for optimization problem research / A+ / Machine learning Optimization, and I was able to learn techniques for weight reduction. Starting with the history of machine learning and deep learning / A / Deep learning, it helped me understand the overall concepts such as CNN and RNN. I participated in NAVER AI RUSH 2020, which competes for ranking by putting a deep learning model on the real-time ranking board to increase AI modeling ability. I experienced the problem of the Imperfect database for the first time by challenging the automatic classification section of the Naver shopping review image in the second round. Although the given dataset was mixed with imbalance labels and noise, it was only accessible algorithmically because it was given in a form of not being able to directly access the data. To solve this problem, we collected papers on the Balance dataset and Noise robustness and Bag of traces data and applied them step by step. Due to the imbalance, the insufficient ratio of the dataset was filled with augmentation data using oversampling, and generalization of noise data was suppressed by the calculation of the label smoothing loss. When applying this technique, it was confirmed that it increased from the first F1-score 0.46 to 0.67. However, although it has undergone several parameter tuning since then, the performance has not improved anymore, and we have faced difficulties. Meanwhile, we planned to apply a noise refinement method that performs Pseudo labeling only data exceeding a certain confidence score using self-training. Using the model of F1-score 0.67 as the Teacher model, we generated a better Student model with the refined dataset, and we repeated the cyclic structure of refining the data with the generated Student model as the Teacher again. We were able to get the effect of increasing the F1-score to 0.81. After that, we learned the models of several network structures using refined data labels and raised the performance with Ensemble to create the final model of F1-score 0.879. We won second place in the ""Results"" competition. I thought that I was able to solve the problem and reach the high ranking because I really enjoyed and immersed myself in it. Through cause analysis and systematic implementation, we learned the approach to solving the problem of the Imperfect dataset and it became a valuable experience to grow further by faithfully learning the basic knowledge of image classification. After the ""What's Too Much"" competition, I looked up materials and seminars on model performance improvement and learned that K-fold cross-validation, image mixup augmentation, and small batch size are more advantageous in generalization because they are taught in flat shapes. It is a simple technique that can be easily applied, but it was regrettable that it was not applied at the time of the competition. If I enter a similar competition again, I decided to show my improved skills with the goal of winning the first place."
"While working as corporate supporters, I was in charge of the planning department in a product planning project suitable for the local commercial district and held a meeting. Based on the target group and purpose of the product, a report that synthesizes the effective product and expected effects had to be submitted within a week. I thought it was best to accept and respect the stories of all the team members and produce satisfactory results for everyone. However, I found that this open attitude was not effective when it came to meetings. It is because the efficiency of time has been too low for everyone to agree. First of all, we emphasized that there is a common goal of planning the most effective product within the local commercial district, and changed it to prioritize and make up for the shortcomings through mutual consultation. Thanks to the attitude of accepting the other person's opinion, I was able to actively communicate with people, but I realize that it is not a good thing to be unconditionally tailored to others, so I am working hard to assert myself little by little. I worked as a hall management manager at a fast food restaurant two years ago. Located next to the theater, there were an average of 10 minutes a day of customers complaining that the waiting time for the movie to start was long. Both customers and employees were struggling with repeated complaints, so I thought about ways to improve customer satisfaction and store image. Through a book related to customer psychology, I learned that when customers feel that they have waited longer than they thought or when they cannot guess how long they should wait, they feel that the waiting time is long psychologically. So, I told the manager and bought several stopwatches. We provided a stopwatch with waiting times entered upon payment. As a result, the number of customers complaining about waiting time decreased from an average of 10 to 5 per day, as well as the number of complaints about waiting time decreased from 10 to 5 per day, and the number of complaints related to service was reduced compared to the previous one. I will work in a positive attitude with a sense of responsibility, thinking that even the slightest opinion can be of great help. I conducted a simulation of management during my college class. Our team's goal was to win first place with the most investment. We only divided opinions that were not organized because we wanted to achieve good results in a short period of time. So, I started organizing the tasks one by one to achieve our goals. First of all, I divided into the planning department and the public relations department. The meeting was allowed to be held by each department, and then the integrated meeting was held. The meeting, which was filled with only various opinions, became more specific and completed, and had a direction. Also, everyone was able to work in their respective roles. As a result, I was able to win the overall title, which was my goal. This gave me an opportunity to feel that good results will naturally follow if I let go of my impatience and go through the tasks in front of me one by one. I think the most necessary skill for this task is to classify data according to each standard based on the use of computers. I have been gaining computer-related certificates for a long time and have endeavored to acquire related knowledge and utilization skills to develop data collection and processing capabilities. I applied for related classes during the semester and built up basic knowledge, and during vacation, I developed analysis, interpretation, and practical skills based on big data analysis education and industry data education. In addition, while working part-time at a restaurant and classifying food materials according to the list, I personally realized the importance of classifying and registering them according to the standards. Based on the importance felt through experience, I will handle the task of organizing and registering a list of public data within the institution with a sense of responsibility. Based on our ability to use computers, we will actively and sincerely carry out training for performing tasks so that we can help you perform real tasks."
"Looking at ""Zeus"" and ""Tibero"" SW, which made Tmax possible today, I felt that it was one of the few companies that knew the importance of securing original technology, and I applied because I was convinced that I was a company that could work for the rest of my life by receiving the news that spared no effort to invest about 1 trillion won in technology to make another leap. I think it is the basis for supporting this that decades have passed, it has affected Korea's No. 1 middleware sector, Korea's best DBMS system, and even leading large companies and overseas public institutions. Based on the ability to prepare for a technology start-up based on the knowledge I have studied while working as an assistant researcher at the lab for more than a year, I have an ambition to use Tmax's technology to find a new industry group and create another opportunity to make a big leap with my own hands by doing business, consulting, and business planning that directly affects the company's sales. My biggest advantage is that I have a history of preparing for a start-up, so I have a quick understanding of technology and am passionate in persuading and understanding others. In order to develop various capabilities as a worker in the future, I have always taken internal and external education centered on SW as well as mechanical engineering, and based on this, I felt a sense of accomplishment through challenges such as registering bio-technical papers, participating in a competition for financial phenomena, preparing for start-ups, and completing AI education. The downside is that I am active and passionate, so I have a strong desire to win. When not only I but also my people and my team are broken, I stay up all night to make up for the shortcomings or to supplement the shortcomings of logic or materials and dig in until the other party is persuaded. By harmonizing these advantages and disadvantages, I have received the Bronze Award from the Director of Defense Acquisition Program Administration at a startup competition hosted by the Defense Acquisition Program Administration, which proposes a business model by utilizing the convergence and connection of technology and technology, which is the core of the fourth industry. In particular, my business item is an ICT wearable device that utilizes future technologies that represent creation and challenges, and was developed to prevent ""sickness"" accidents, which are three major safety accidents in the private sector, along with crashes and crashes. The biggest difference from the current suffocation prevention device in the market is that it is a ""system"" in which internal workers wear a ""wearable"" device and ""simultaneously"" measure the concentration of bio-signals and harmful gases in real time, and send them to external workers. As it was not just an idea competition, but a startup competition, I focused my efforts on writing a business plan and building a business model. I wanted to create an item that I had always pursued to pursue a safe and shared world, so I set the concept as an item that realizes the public values of safety accident prevention from the beginning of the design. The B2G model was laid as the base, and the business areas of the country market were specified by referring to OOO's 2019 business report. In addition, while taking the training organized by OOO and OOO, I learned how to read business trends and theories that can be really sold in the marketplace that customers want. The results were good, but it was also the most challenging and difficult thing in my life. I formed a team with three people and took on the role of the team leader, and the rest were students in the electronics department and the junior colleagues in the medical engineering lab, who I learned through participation in lab assignments. As such a diverse group of people formed a team, there was no choice but to have disagreements. Instead of listening to the needs of my team members, I resolved the conflict by giving them other relatively easy tasks. To my greed, I wanted to apply deep learning technology to the measured data and even apply a technology that minimizes errors to the prototype. However, as a result of the discussion, I agreed that the team members of the electronic engineering department were less attractive to appeal to the judges compared to the efforts they made in the technology, and included it only in the future business plan. Instead of taking a step back from the application of deep learning technology, I assigned the student an additional task related to the communication technology that I was most confident in. For communication in confined spaces, I participated in a meeting with a contest mentor to listen to technical advice on research on how to apply military tactical communication. Through communication, I solved the problem in the direction of moving forward to the common goal by appropriately assigning different tasks when there was a conflict, and I was able to win the prize with a good result of being sixth out of 151 teams."
"I applied because I wanted to contribute to CJ Olive Networks' top tier-level life culture digital service provision business. While majoring in computer engineering, my ultimate goal became to deliver value to customers through new technologies. Looking at Olive Networks' ""Factory One,"" I felt that it was a solution that combines the latest technologies, such as accurately grasping customer needs that fit the trend, applying ""blockchain"" to secure information and providing solutions using ""artificial intelligence."" I want to work with Olive Networks, which creates value by satisfying the needs of users with these innovative technologies. In addition, I applied for the job because I wanted to apply the web development capabilities I had accumulated in my undergraduate years to such value creation. I will always grow with a learning attitude and communicate to become CJ's Only One developer. To do this, I have three capabilities. First, I developed analytical thinking and problem solving skills by taking on the backend role in project development. I have experience in developing APIs using Springboot and distributing them through AWS. I solved the development problem through debugging and analyzed the situation to solve the error in the distribution process. This will be helpful in providing more convenient and safe services to CJ Olive Networks' customers. Second, we constantly challenge ourselves to accept and apply new technologies. In the graduation project, we developed a depression test web service based on SNS data and machine learning. We conducted research to increase the accuracy and published it as a thesis. Based on these capabilities, we will strive to combine CJ One Data with new technologies, and we will contribute to the development of innovative CJ services based on this. Third, we are good at collaborating and communicating. During my internship, I had experience in collaborating with planners and designers and renewing actual services. At that time, I was short on time due to a short internship period, but I suggested it to other team members to make a systematic plan and explained the development language so that other team members could understand it easily. As a result, I was able to successfully complete the renewal within the internship period. I would like to introduce CJ's own service by pioneering and developing new fields through differentiated analysis and understanding of customers. With the advent of the 4th Industrial Revolution, new technologies are pouring out from 6G predictions beyond 5G to artificial intelligence and IoT. Using these technologies, I think we need to understand various customer companies such as Korea Express, CheilJedang, and CJ ENM and develop advanced services accordingly. Therefore, I will achieve this goal by becoming a developer who internalizes the understanding and analysis of technology and customers for the development of CJ's best service. To this end, I will make the following efforts. First, I will understand CJ Olive Networks and its team members. Development at CJ Olive Networks is not about being alone, but a combination of cooperation with team members who are outstanding in each field and CJ Olive Networks' know-how. What is important in the system development work is that it contributes to the achievement of the company's challenging goals, but I think you are a true expert only when you can overcome work problems with your team members. Rather than thinking only about my position, I will always think about my colleagues' position and become a team member who I want to work with. Also, I will think about why these goals are necessary for the company's work and try to understand the business by engraving the words and goals of CJ Olive Networks CEO. Second, I will strengthen my technology. The IT development job I applied for continues to come out with the latest technologies and demands a lot of expertise. Therefore, I will constantly pursue interest in new technologies, accept new technologies, and develop them through the in-house talent education system. I will think about how to strengthen my technology and apply them to the service more innovatively and conveniently. Finally, I will understand the customers. I will understand the customers by analyzing them with interest in their processes and environment. In addition, I will not let go of my interest in the trend and study the customized services of the customers that fit the flow. Based on this, I will truly identify the needs of the customers and develop innovative services."
"""Next generation security leader who strives steadily"" I did a lot of activities related to my application job. In particular, I focused a lot on information security. When new items came out, I always wondered and studied what was different from the existing ones. Coding is also necessary for analysis of vulnerable source codes based on white boxes, so I had to learn various languages such as C.C ++, Python, and assembly. As a result, I was able to achieve good grades in a number of programming subjects, and in the case of security, it was very helpful to know how to attack them to secure them. In order to understand more detail, I created a virtual environment and practiced attack. I joined the hacking/security club on campus, studied the club, presented seminars, and learned more about the technical aspects. As a reporter for the college student at a related company, I was able to encounter a lot of things that were happening in the information security field since I was in the lower grade. In the case of the military, I was assigned to the information protection soldier and operated equipment such as NAC, UTM, and vaccine server to manage nodes and PCs under the corps. After that, while working on the IT project, I was able to analyze the weaknesses of IoT equipment and digital signage using Bluetooth with my mentor. In the case of the project, I was able to receive bugbounties and letters of appreciation in recognition of the achievements of the project. In addition, I received the Outstanding Papers Award at the Korea OOO Association Winter Conference by writing a paper on how to trigger related vulnerabilities and the Outstanding Papers Award for undergraduate students at the Korea OOO Association. With the skills gained from these experiences, I went to the contest titled 'Find OOO Security Holes' hosted by the Korea OOO Corporation and won the top prize. ""A lot of experience makes me competent."" By doing many activities related to the job, I was able to gain job experience and at the same time develop my collaboration and communication skills. Information security, which is my major field, has experienced everything from management to analysis to office work. I think there may be experiences that are necessary and not necessary for performing a job. Since I have little experience in communication, I only have no experience using equipment such as routers, switches, and UPS, and job training is required for other equipment. However, I am passionate and confident that I can perform any task. If I join the Incheon Transportation Corporation, I will try to learn how to use the equipment quickly based on my experience and become familiar with the work so that I can faithfully complete my work. In this era of increasing wireless communication, Haneum's wireless security project will also be helpful in building or operating facilities. ""Passion, Becoming the Driver of Dreams."" I am a passionate person. Since I was young, I had a hobby of disassembling and fixing electronic devices myself when they broke down. Sometimes I got hurt, but when something was fixed, I felt good and was interested in solving the problem. Then one day, my computer at home broke down and I tried to fix it, but I failed. Then, a relative who was a computer science student came home and disassembled the computer to fix it, and at that time, I was fascinated by complex and simple computers. That's how I went to a related department. After going to school, I studied information protection and thought it was difficult but fun, and I was able to participate in hacking/security clubs on campus, present studies and seminars, and practice technical aspects. The military also applied as a computer soldier, and I received an information security soldier in my own university and served. By managing the PCs and servers under the Corps, I was able to learn more about the importance of information protection, and I prepared/audited various security audits to enhance my understanding of security settings. I think the basics of communication are operational capabilities and security. I think I have an experience that is suitable for this. ""Improving Security"" There are more embedded devices than in the past, and there are many situations where the Internet is connected. Security will be important if smart cities are developed in the future and V2M networks become practical. Accordingly, I think Incheon Transportation Corporation should check the security trend of the latest technology and refer to it when building new technologies. Connection is important, but sustainability is also important, so investment and talent training are necessary for sustainable security. Accordingly, before Incheon Transportation Corporation steps forward and applies a new technology, it should conduct a vulnerability analysis and take an agile work format to supplement it. Security will improve over time if problems are discovered periodically and continuously supplemented. While working on the ""strong when together"" vulnerability analysis project, each team member has a different progress schedule and method, so I had a hard time coordinating disagreements about the project schedule. Each team member had a preferred method of progress. Through conversation, the team member's experiences, strengths, and weaknesses were identified, and the work efficiency was increased by dividing the task to achieve the purpose of the project earlier than expected. Therefore, I believe that when living in a community, I should have colleagues around me, rather than someone who is indispensable. Everyone takes it for granted that they always have a colleague next to them. Some colleagues' work seems to be more rested than I am. However, if I try to do that person's work instead of me, I feel that the work that seems to be resting was more difficult than I thought. I think that the person in charge of anything should recognize and respect its value because they are experts. ""Looking at it from a different perspective"" I once participated in a competition called ""Find OOO Security Loopholes"" hosted by the Korea Transportation Safety Authority. It was conducted in the form of receiving points when finding vulnerabilities on the homepage, and the scoreboard was shared in real time, so it was a system that allowed us to know how many points our team had earned and what the ranking was. There was time left, but there were no more vulnerabilities, so only time was passing. Our team, which wanted to be in the top rankings, needed some points.I was wondering if there was a good way, but I found new sites by changing the language of the same homepage that other teams had not tried. As a result, I was able to find pages that I had not found before and had the experience of analyzing vulnerabilities. As a result, I performed well and won the grand prize. ""Security Regulations that do not know internal circumstances."" When I was in the military, I worked in the information protection class. In the case of information protection equipment, there is a password management ledger, and a related work manager was required to see the password management ledger. However, related workmen had to commute to work and the information protection system should have been operated 24 hours a day. The soldiers working here had to call the executive when changing or browsing the password, which they thought was a waste of time that was quite unnecessary. The upper-level unit at the headquarters level had a 24-hour rotation, but the lower-level unit was not able to work 24 hours a day due to insufficient personnel. I discussed this with the platoon leader, and I exercised my discretion to the extent that the regulations were followed, granting the relevant authority to the seniors at the squad leader level. As a result, soldiers are less likely to call in executives even if they work 24 hours a day, and executives are also less likely to visit. ""The company that develops because of me"" I am a student who is very interested in in information protection. While seriously considering my senior year in high school, I learned about information protection, went to the university's department of information protection, received several academic scholarships, and worked in the military as an information security guard. However, up until this point, my weakness was that I lacked perseverance compared to the passion I wanted to do. However, I came to learn persistence by meeting good executives in the military. As a result, I was able to win first place for the first time since the establishment of the unit at the squad leader training center on Onda. Before I left the military, I had always studied various fields only through superficial education, but after I was discharged from the military, I thought that I should do it one by one properly, so I am continuing to challenge myself with persistence. The fact that I am fulfilling my goal until I achieve it was thought that the milestone toward the global future that Incheon Transportation Corporation aims for was a good match for me, so I applied. I have studied information protection for a long time and I think I have the potential to develop further. I will develop and develop this potential with the seniors who are working."
"My motivation for applying to the National Information Society Agency was to help me learn professionally about building big data platforms and networks. Establish policies and activation plans related to the creation of a data ecosystem for the revitalization of intelligent information technology such as big data and artificial intelligence, collect various data, processing and empirical analysis of statistical data, collecting and comparing and analyzing data related to social phenomena and policy trends, preparing reports through big data analysis, data mining, machine learning, planning and strategies to produce and build data, establishing plans and strategies to revitalize distribution and transactions, business management on big data platforms and network construction projects, and I would like to participate in the establishment of policies and activation plans related to the creation of an ecosystem for the revitalization of intelligent information technology such as big data and artificial intelligence. By gaining experience and skills through hands-on experience, I will acquire big data and artificial intelligence technology, one of the technologies of the 4th industrial revolution, which will serve as the basis for revitalizing the big data platform and network construction business of the National Information Society Agency. I have been working in SI for about three years at a venture company and automating manufacturing plants for about four years. Although the field was different from the IT business of the National Information Society Agency, I worked as the basis for the smart factory business in the manufacturing plant automation field. While developing the company's software, such as developing industrial board-related software and developing embedded WinCE in venture companies, I participated in production-related system development projects such as MES and MCS, which are factory automation solutions. The technology in venture companies was only a developer's specifications. When I first encountered manufacturing automation, I had difficulty attending meetings with manufacturing equipment engineers, solving problems occurring in manufacturing equipment, checking requirements for issues that would become an issue, and working together on actual development jobs were difficult. However, after several equipment meetings and meetings, I got used to the work, making it easier to meet more than seven equipment, and I gained confidence in the work. Later, I also communicated with female Japanese engineers. When I was in college, I was asked by my friend to be the deputy director of the Propaganda and Planning Department of the Natural University Student Association. It was a position where it was difficult to create a member of my subordinate department because the work of the Propaganda and Planning Department was more laborious than other departments. The student council president and I were in charge of the propaganda planning department, but since it was our first time meeting it, the organization called the student council was unfamiliar, and I wanted to quit as well because I was unfamiliar with the work done by the student council. I cried a lot, and I was under the pressure of doing it alone, so I didn't know what to do. I learned the work of the planning department one by one with the help of my friends and the student council president whenever that happened. I had to make my own PC for the campus, make a handwritten poster, plan student council events, inform my classmates of the event at the festival, and there were many small chores. The student council president and I were unfamiliar with the work even though the members of the propaganda planning department who came in late said that it was delayed, but my friends said that it was surprising to see me working in an organization called the Natural University Student Council. Words like gentle, moral example, and conscientious attitude come to mind as the most important virtues for employees working in public institutions. I believe that working in a public institution, you should be gentle without being overly involved in corruption or corruption, and that you should be a moral example for other people's requests for personnel management. So, I think that being honest with my work, working with a sense of mission and expertise in my job, and working with the National Information Society Agency should be creative and have different ideas. Of course, I was quiet and easy-going, satisfied with my work, and worked with expertise. I don't know if I was exemplary and gentle enough to be a model for others. As an employee of the National Information Society Agency, I will develop a sense of mission in big data and AI data analysis with a sense of duty in my job with an analytical and critical attitude. *2 years and 7 months of experience in venture company/software development job *From the computer BIOS update program to the company's board diagnostic program, embedded WinCE development, embedded WinCE development, participation in KOFA2000 car fairy tale exhibition at COEX, development website for company introduction, etc. *Learning expertise in hardware and bios, attending seminars for embedded WinCE development, and acquiring expertise in third-party device drivers, etc. * Inform the public about and promote the company as an industrial board producer *3 years and 7 months of experience in manufacturing automation SI / Software engineer's job *Manufacturing equipment CIM development, equipment server development, MCS system development, MES system SM, etc. *From LCD manufacturing equipment team to MES data base system development, 40% contribution to the successful automation setup of LCD manufacturing plant * Establish policies and activation plans to create an intelligent information ecosystem such as big data and artificial intelligence of the National Information Society Agency. Business management on matters related to big data platform and network construction business. Based on expertise in related fields such as information engineering, data engineering, computer engineering, big data, and artificial intelligence, such as big data analysis, data mining, and machine learning, we will maintain an attitude to identify and accept the requirements of various stakeholders. We will learn related business management guidelines and accounting regulations such as ICT business and information and communication R&D with an active and responsible attitude and an analytical and critical attitude to solve problems. Based on our knowledge of the latest ICT issues and trends such as big data and artificial intelligence, we will faithfully carry out our work based on our experience and experience."
"In order to coordinate the opinions of manufacturing equipment engineers, equipment server development engineers, and process engineers while automating the LCD manufacturing of LG displays, it is important to keep a good record of the meeting from the time the meeting is held, and the meeting is important from the initial project design stage. Setting the scope of work development is also coordinated during the meeting, which makes the meeting difficult due to disagreements. Coordination of work is important because the scope that equipment engineers need to develop and the development requirements of most process engineers determine the scope of equipment server development during the project. It was my job to coordinate the requirements of such equipment engineers and process engineers. In order to avoid disruptions to the development schedule, process engineers reflected the requirements in their work, demanded work from equipment engineers, and set up equipment, so the work requirements had to be continuously reflected until the final testing of equipment and processes. And whenever there was a conflict of work, it was necessary to make concessions and consider each other. In order to coordinate the opinions of manufacturing equipment engineers, equipment server development engineers, and process engineers, it is important to keep a good record of the meeting from the time the meeting is held while automating the LCD manufacturing of LG displays. The business meeting is also important from the initial project design stage. Setting the scope of work development is also coordinated during the business meeting, which makes the business meeting difficult due to disagreements. Coordination of work is important because the scope that equipment engineers need to develop and the development requirements of most process engineers determine the scope of equipment server development during the project. It was my job to coordinate the requirements of such equipment engineers and process engineers. In order to avoid disruptions to the development schedule, process engineers reflected the requirements in their work, required work from equipment engineers, and set up equipment, so the work requirements had to be continuously reflected until the final testing of equipment and processes. And whenever there was a conflict of work, it was necessary to make concessions and consider each other. In order to develop a better system, we were pushed into the project schedule and the development schedule was not met, so we reduced the scope of development to carry out the project. At that time, there were four work developments assigned to me, and it was difficult to develop them and how long they could develop them. As I was developing a new system, I had to learn many new technologies, but I finally completed the development, and I completed the development well, and wrote related documents. Most of the developer's concerns disappeared when the project was completed. As I finished the project, all the worries about how much to develop? How to reflect the customer's requirements disappeared. Eventually, I got feedback from people around me that I did a good job on the project. I felt good because the pressure on development, which I had been worried about throughout the project, disappeared, and I was proud of the result that I did a good job. This happened while working on the LG Display P5 plant equipment server development project. We test communication protocols with seven types of LCD equipment. In order to meet each equipment engineer, we personally visit the equipment vendor and ask the process engineer to set a meeting date for the task of interworking testing with the equipment and equipment server, and make a business agreement. When do you do interlocking testing, and there is a task that requires testing using actual glass inside the actual factory, but once you enter the factory, it is inconvenient to come out, so once you enter the factory, you cannot come out until the end of testing. And you can test the system in the factory only when you ask the equipment engineer for work and the process engineer's order falls out. We test the system using all human resources, systems, facilities, etc. The project was successfully completed, and the discord in the initial design was well considered for each other. The experience related to information technology operation of information technology in the field of information and communication of Korea Gas Corporation in the field of computer science and communication is based on the status report of each equipment of LG Display through the equipment CIM of the P4 and P5 factories, the system status of the current equipment, and how the equipment is operating, and receive the instruction of the equipment team automatically through the manufacturing and automation system under the instruction of the upper server. We developed a system that monitors whether the work was done properly in the process with the equipment information received through these tasks, and checks the accuracy of the data values from the upper server. With a series of experience and experience, I think we can do a good job of analyzing all the problems presented through continuous inspection and monitoring of hardware and software in the information and communication-information technology-information technology operation position of Korea Gas Corporation and take appropriate measures for preventive activities and problems that have occurred. As implied by Korea Gas Corporation's words, ""The efforts of Korea Gas Corporation continue today so that all Koreans can draw a better world with good energy."" I believe that the efforts of the Korea Gas Corporation instill trust in people, such as challenges to the world, responsibility to society, changes to the future for a better world, and a better world so that it can be used conveniently and safely by the people of other countries as well as by the gas of the Korean people. While working, I also thought about how my IT value can change the future society and take social responsibility for those changes. And that's what I've been doing. If one small thought has a good influence on future changes, my value will rise, and my efforts will be worthwhile. That's why I acted out of fear and consideration for others, thinking that my selfish behavior might have a negative or negative impact on others.If I have a good energy for others and it has a good effect on others, I would be happy if it was a good thing for others. It was because of the warm heating system of Korea Gas Corporation that I could spend winter warm and safe at home, spring, summer, and fall, and I am surprised and grateful that it was today's effort. I think the value that matches my capability and the value that matches the value of Korea Gas Corporation is a responsibility to society. Is the system I developed right to create a system that can take social responsibility? Isn't there a social responsibility that a person should do to reduce human work by reducing manpower in an increasingly convenient system IT? Wouldn't it be possible to minimize the repetitive work of the person using my system to give him a better warvel and more leisure time after work? Can't my system reduce mistakes in repeated work? I think we need to develop the system in consideration of our responsibility to the society. The kitchen system of today has been more advanced, and it has been a while since an induction electric stove rather than a gas stove was turned on. Now gas is not a gas for cooking, but a gas for heating and supplying warm water. However, there are still many countries that do not use gas in underdeveloped foreign countries. I think there are countless developments of the Korea Gas Corporation in foreign countries. I think we need to supply our gas systems to more foreign countries so that we can become the Korea Gas Corporation of the world, not the Korea Gas Corporation of Korea."
"I applied for the Korea Housing Corporation because of the employment of computerized workers, and the criteria for choosing a job are to have a stable job that suits my aptitude and does what I can. I applied for the computerized job because my major is OOOOOO and I have worked for 6 years and 3 months as a system development worker. I applied for the computerized job in consideration of the annual salary level of new employees. I also liked the purpose of the Korea Housing Corporation, which aims to contribute to the promotion of the welfare of the people and the development of the national economy by promoting long-term and stable supply of housing finance as an institution that improves the welfare of the people. I will play my role as an employee of the Korea Housing Finance Corporation, which strives to improve the quality of life of the people and provide stable housing for the people, with the vision of an institution that improves the quality of life of the people by improving the housing welfare of the people and improves the housing welfare of the people. As the saying goes, ""Homeless Sadness,"" I think that for ordinary people who have been homeless for a long time, creative talents such as Danbi from the Korea Housing Corporation, experts in housing finance business, and a harmonious person with horizontal thinking who knows how to read the hearts of customers, and who can take care of them with a warm heart, I will do my duty as an employee of the public corporation. In the organizational culture, I think that ""open"" mind thinking is a word that is altruistic and incorporates the concept of everyone by respecting and caring for the will of me and others. I think it is not my own thoughts or ideas, but to collect everyone's opinions and narrow the difference of opinion with others by considering others, and reach an appropriate agreement without pursuing only my own interests, unless it is an open mind and respect and consideration for others. While developing the system, I think it is a belief that I should have the ability to persuade others with my conclusions while respecting the opinions of others who have different opinions from me. Just as I need someone to listen to my opinion to accept my opinion, I think the attitude of understanding and accepting the other person's opinion is also a necessary attitude to work with an open mind. The product that I am most interested in, the Bogeumjari Loan, can be applied for the purpose of purchasing a new house, returning jeonse funds, and repaying existing mortgage loans, and it is suitable for customers who want to avoid the risk of future interest rate fluctuations by applying a stable fixed interest rate from the date of loan to maturity. The reason is that it is a fixed-rate mortgage loan that is so low that you must know about Bogeumjari if you want to get a house. In order to become an expert on Bogeumjari products, I will explain in detail the advantages and disadvantages of Bogeumjari Loan, such as application targets, loan interest rates, target housing, adjustment target areas, etc., and explain in detail the advantages and disadvantages of Bogeumjari Loan, such as loan period, repayment method, and income proof method. I will kindly guide the people who want to apply for the Bogeumjari Loan, choose which loan interest rate, determine the repayment period, determine the repayment period, and the necessary documents for receiving the loan. People in their 20s and 30s are in their early social life and are in their early social life, and those in their 20s, who are starting their first social life, will live in a one-room monthly rent room or a house that pays a deposit rather than a vague future dream of getting a house. People in their 30s are more likely to get a new home or start anew with a lease on a deposit basis loan from housing finance or a lease on a deposit basis. People in their 40s and 50s are considered to be at the age when they can use the lease on a deposit basis loan from housing finance or use the lease on a deposit basis loan. People in their 40s and 50s are also considered to be able to use the lease on a deposit basis as well as an increase in their children's housing. I think that people in their 60s are old enough to buy a home for their children or buy a house for retirement. That's why I think it's better to design the role of the Housing Finance Corporation by separating the needs of housing for each age group. It is already being implemented, but I think it will be a reliable housing corporation that will make the housing corporation's wish come true by expanding the housing loan at a lower interest rate with more generality and publicity so that it can benefit the common people and end users who want to buy a home for themselves. My public interest-oriented experience was volunteering to interpret the English translation of OOO OOO OOO OOO OOO athletes' village in 2003. At that time, Daegu City made efforts to attract international sports competitions and establish an athletes' village in Daegu. After the competition, the apartments made for the athletes' village inside and outside the city were returned to ordinary Daegu citizens, and the apartment in Dongbyeon-dong, which was now an athletes' village, has become a private apartment where ordinary citizens live. In fact, some volunteers came to volunteer to win the apartment. It was the first time I knew that the Korea Housing Corporation was engaged in various public interest-oriented activities to fulfill its responsibilities to society. I think something good will happen to you to know that there is a construction called the Korea Housing Corporation for the people as well as the importance of houses."
"""A talent who continues to grow"" I have worked for a startup for a long time and have learned how to effectively apply it to my work by continuously strengthening my capabilities to smoothly perform new tasks. For three years, I have been working at a startup to analyze data and build marketing plans and strategies for digital marketing to brands. Startups have a lot of new work to do, but there is nothing that they have done so far. In startups, capacity building was essential. Recently, I have led the way in building a web based on data as well as analyzing data that I have been doing before. I constantly searched and acquired information on what part to prepare before outsourcing development, produced flowcharts, development requests, and prototyping to hold meetings with developers. After that, I was able to leave a very good impression on each developer I met to select an outsourcing company. Based on the prepared data, the meeting could be concluded easily, and later development was also made smoothly by modifying the plan into a basic frame. In the process, I also learned how to write an outsourced development contract, so I didn't miss out on continuous maintenance and obtaining a source code license. I am a continuously growing talent who knows what to learn, learns about it, and can use the acquired knowledge efficiently even in this ever-changing startup environment."
"""Happy NCsoft"" games are another world and people find joy in games. Pleasure is the emotion that people seek to be happy. So I think that people make games. I think NCsoft, a company that makes games that make people happy, is a company that knows how to make employees happy. Coincidentally, my current job is near NCsoft's Seonneung office building. Sometimes during lunch time, I can see NCsoft's employees proudly hanging their employee ID cards and eating, but it seemed that they were always talking about work. At first, I thought that they were busy enough to work until lunchtime, but the vague stories were conversations about trying to do better. Besides that, it was always impressive to see NCsoft's employees smiling when I saw them coming out of the building. In addition, when I saw various personnel decisions and articles about CEO Taekjin Kim, who is affectionately called ""Lee Hyung,"" I thought that NCsoft is a company that thinks of people and knows how to do great. My company life has always been a challenge. I first encountered data four years ago, and I fell in love with data analysis that can get the correct answer based on the solid basis of data. From data extraction to preprocessing to visualization, I have continuously studied data analysis and experienced the overall data analysis process in practice. In addition, I have periodically developed my competencies through data analysis-related conferences and data analysis training. Four years have passed as a data analyst, but I still want to learn that I have to learn a lot. I think the quality of a good data analyst comes from learning. I want to become a specialist in data analysis by continuously learning many data analysts with the help of seniors and good colleagues at NCSOFT. ""To quench the thirst of clients through data analysis"" The most memorable thing was to have a heated meeting with the strategic planning team of a large company A to continuously communicate on how to search for an advertising model that fits the brand and fit, and to analyze the data according to the needs to derive the desired answer. The reason was that I was able to mobilize all of my knowledge. I think it was an opportunity to refresh my mind at work to find the answer using my knowledge of data analysis to the fullest instead of my previous analysis work as a data analyst. I still can't forget the pleasure of not giving up and writing and weaving all my knowledge to find the answer my client wanted."

"The reason why I chose Pulmuone is a job that suits my corporate image and aptitude. I think the name Pulmuone itself is a company that people who live in Korea and use the mart cannot help but know. Also, Pulmuone is known for its healthy and young image, so I thought it was a company with the corporate culture and development consciousness that I wanted. In addition, I applied because I thought that choosing a job that suits my aptitude is a very important part of my life. When I was a bachelor, my main goal was to become a hardware developer. To this end, I completed the LG Embedded Software Track and took various related classes such as digital engineering, computer structure, digital system design, embedded computing system, operating system, SoC structure and design. Based on this experience, I was interested in semiconductors and went to graduate school to learn more about semiconductor-related jobs. Since then, through the graduate school, I have not only gained deeper knowledge related to hardware, but also gained close experience to practical work. I hope that a place like this will become Pulmuone. I have experience working as an early member of a security club during college. As an early member, I tried to lay the foundation for the club and promote the new club. In addition, we didn't miss gathering in the club to do security learning. For efficiency, we mainly recruited studies in the desired field and conducted learning by participating in them. I was interested in many fields and participated in a number of studies such as database, network, and reverting, and it was difficult to conduct many studies at the same time, but as a result, I realized that I could do anything if I had a strong mindset and effort. Thanks to the efforts of the early members, our club flourished day by day and held simple security competitions within the club. Unfortunately, however, since I graduated, the appearance of the club to visit has changed a lot. Seeing this, I realized that without a clear sense of goal, an organization that had already been established could change, and I was able to be alert again to myself. After entering college, I had vaguely difficult and avoided team activities. However, through the club, team activities are not difficult, but I have come to feel that what I can't do is a wonderful activity where I can do what I can, get help, and work with individuals to perform bigger tasks. This experience reminded me of the team's charm and eliminated vague fear. At the same time, it was a great experience for me to learn that the team is not alone, and if the members of the team do not get the right results, the right results will not come out. My strength is that I have persistence. This is what I have learned by looking at the back of my father who is always working hard in his career. I once did a project in college that I had to study and proceed with by myself what I didn't learn in a major subject. Although I could have carried out a project like an example compilation, I found and studied on my own to complete a project that distinguishes me from other groups, and I received good reviews and contributed to the organization. Also, because of this advantage, until now, I have not given up even if problems arise when developing programs, and have constantly worked to solve errors. Rather, it was an opportunity to improve my SW development ability by being able to find out and learn new things while solving that error. As I have done so far, if there is anything I do not know in the future job, I will continue to work patiently to learn and adapt to the job faster than others. The downside is that I have less knowledge of current events. I think it could be a critical issue, so I am currently reflecting on myself and continuously trying to understand by reading newspapers to fill in my late knowledge of current events. I want to become one of the major developers of the new project 10 years after joining the company. To this end, I will not only strengthen my basic skills, but I will also continue to participate in seminars on the latest technology trends and gain a lot of knowledge. In addition, I think many exchanges create new ideas, so I would like to learn English, Japanese, and Chinese as well as the current foreign language skills and create new exchanges and new ideas accordingly. Furthermore, I want to become a developer who can develop more efficient and better systems by developing not only considering software but also hardware."
"I have acquired a lot of software-related knowledge through my university course, and I am especially confident in embedded software coding that is closely related to the operating system. Since then, I have developed and tested HEVC's CABAC encoder and decoder, one of the most commonly used high-definition video codecs in the lab for two years, and developed IP with my master's graduation work and conducted MPW to write a thesis. I learned the background knowledge necessary for research by helping develop and test the encoder like a senior for the first year, and I studied and completed the development on my own for the second year. In addition, by managing tasks in the lab, writing necessary materials, and conducting presentations, I have gained basic practical knowledge and the ability to freely handle document tools, and have become more familiar with coding on the Linux environment. Various education and conferences that I participated in, such as neuromorphic hardware courses for the realization of future artificial intelligence, also gave me a lot of background knowledge and enlightenment. I'm sure that my hands-on experience in the lab and development in a team with my seniors will help me quickly adapt to the Korea Tourism Organization. I have been to OO as an overseas volunteer. In my own way, I studied and prepared English in advance in order to sufficiently conduct preliminary research on the local area in Korea and overcome the language difference, which is the basis of communication. However, most of the Nepalese who actually did not know English. Basically, the language, diet, and culture were all different, so I thought a lot about what to do to really communicate with them. And I got a hint from the behavior of one of the team members. The team member was just talking to the children in Korean. Although the actual language did not work, I realized from this experience that if there is a sincere effort to convey the intention, my heart can be conveyed. During the next period, I also tried to share my heart with anything, and through that, I was able to gain a rewarding experience. Also, at the same time, I realized the importance of preliminary research and background knowledge. When I wanted to go to graduate school, I faced my mother's opposition. In order to resolve my mother's conflict and persuade her, I thought that I needed to first know what she really wanted, and I also felt that I needed to have a lot of conversations with her. So, over the course of several months, I had deep conversations with my mother about this. Through this conversation, I was able to understand my mother's opinion in various aspects, not only in terms of going to graduate school, which was the problem I encountered at the time. Through this experience, I came to realize that time to share opinions is essential in an organization, and this was an opportunity to broaden my understanding of how to achieve harmony among organizations through sharing opinions. As its name suggests, the Korea Tourism Organization is carrying out a number of tourism-related projects. It can be broadly divided into international and domestic tourism, and it carries out detailed businesses such as marketing, public relations, planning, and welfare. Marketing is mainly conducted for international and domestic tourism planning products. In addition to supporting public relations and providing translation-related projects for international customers, public relations are also carried out. Planning plans new tourism projects through various fields that enhance Korea's status, and finally, welfare is carrying out projects in many fields, such as many welfare services to revitalize domestic tourism projects and direct vacation support projects."
"I applied for East-West Power because I want to participate in helping people live a convenient life and protecting their safety. v I have a lot of experience in volunteer work and have been interested in helping people since a long time ago. Especially, going to volunteer work in person during the Taean oil spill made me think a lot and have an interest in environmental issues. Since then, I have been interested in various environmental issues and have engaged in various activities, including participating in Abaz, an international organization. After years of hard work while continuing these activities, I applied because I thought that although it may not be seen well from the outside, taking care of basic management and helping people is the way to save my dream. Ten years after joining the company, I want to become one of the major developers of the new project. To this end, I will not only strengthen my basic skills but also continue to participate in seminars on the latest technology trends to gain a lot of knowledge. In addition, as I think many exchanges are creating new ideas, I would like to learn not only the current foreign language skills but also English, Japanese, and Chinese as well as new exchanges and new ideas accordingly. Furthermore, I would like to become a developer who can develop more efficient and good systems through development that considers hardware as well as software. As far as I know, Korea East-West Power is currently carrying out several renewable energy generation projects. I think this is the right path for the future and for the environment. However, it would be better if I could manage energy more efficiently and find out which energy is more efficient. I would like to develop a new program so that I can grasp it more clearly through IT technologies such as big data and artificial intelligence that are also used in marketing. My competitiveness is deep knowledge based on dreams I have had since the first year of college. When I was a student, my main goal was to become a hardware developer, but I had to overcome it. I had no background knowledge related to hardware, which was my weakness. To overcome this weakness, I took various related classes such as digital engineering, computer structure, digital system design, embedded computing system, operating system, SoC structure and design. Based on this experience, I was interested in semiconductors and went to graduate school to learn more about semiconductor-related jobs. Since then, through the graduate school, I have not only gained deeper knowledge related to hardware but also gained experience close to practical work. I will try to utilize such practical experience and team experience t persistence."
"Since I was a freshman in university, I have completed the embedded software coding track presented by the department and studied all electronic circuit classes, aiming to become a hardware coding expert rather than a software expert. In addition, I received education such as basic information security and multi-core programming using GPUs, aiming at coding from various perspectives using the time of vacation. Since then, I have been learning background knowledge related to semiconductor since I went to graduate school, thinking that semiconductor is the ultimate hardware coding. I have mainly developed and tested the CABAC decoder of HEVC, one of the video codecs, for two years in the lab. As I developed it, I became familiar with basic semiconductor development using Verilog HDL. After completing the development, I even went to the MPW packaging process to gain experience in circuit development tools such as Synopsys and Cadence. In addition, I have gained the ability to freely handle basic necessary practical knowledge and document tools by managing tasks in the lab, writing necessary materials, and conducting presentations. I am confident that such practical experience in the lab and experience in developing in teams with seniors will help me quickly adapt to the company. Since childhood, I had many opportunities to encounter S/W such as computers and games. So, I was basically interested in programming and naturally chose to major in information, communication, and electronics. Until I entered university, I mainly liked working on projects alone, but one experience made me realize the importance and strength of teamwork. In one of the major subjects of the department, I carried out a patented product development planning team project using wireless communication technology. This required a large amount of work, such as not only planning new products but also preliminary patent research on the planned products, assuming that patents are issued. First of all, we exchanged contacts and made sure that we could always discuss them through messenger. In addition, we had regular meetings and had frequent opportunities to discuss them. At first, I started by coming up with and presenting various topics for a new plan. Several plans came out, but all of them thought their plans were good and wanted to adopt their plans. So, we discussed the strengths and weaknesses of each plan with each other and decided the topic by a majority vote. After the topic was decided, the work of researching patents, writing proposals, and writing presentation materials was divided equally into areas that I could do well. I researched and organized patents and helped write presentation materials. When I divided the work into my field efficiently, I felt that it was progressing much smoother and faster than otherwise. In addition, by gaining a lot of opportunities to discuss, I was able to complete the project more completely because I was able to consider areas that I could not think on my own and consider details. Based on these experiences, I learned that when the team worked together, I could achieve my perfect goal more efficiently. The above experience is one of the most memorable and valuable experiences for me, and it was an opportunity to realize that individual strength is important, but when the power of many people is properly gathered, even greater and greater results can be achieved. Based on this experience, I would like to play a role in the development of the company as one of the developers who contribute to development while maintaining good teamwork."
"""Fusion of strengths and weaknesses"" The new trend of life is 'infinity' which means that nothing can be achieved without sweating. Also, I think its strength is 'depth'. In-depth efforts and knowledge are essential for continuous software service improvement and optimization, not one-time development. When I was an undergraduate, I tried to understand in depth based on the lessons learned when I planned a project. Taking classes in mechanical engineering and electronic engineering, which are other departments, I tried to learn basic mechanical programming and algorithms for HW control, with the theme of a project using drones. On the other hand, the disadvantage is that if you focus on one thing, you will be somewhat neglected in other things. In order to solve this problem, I prepared weekly planners, prioritizing important tasks, and made efforts to live a school life on a planned basis. After joining the Seoul Metropolitan Landfill Management Corporation, I will try to process things by fusing strengths and weaknesses, and derive in-depth results. ""The Value of Developing Together"" Since the 2nd grade, I opened an algorithm study to learn how to fuse various solutions based on communication from the experiences I studied. We solved algorithm problems and reviewed codes once a week with friends from the same department. In the process, we tried to come up with a solution rather than memorizing one standardized method. And by posting what we studied on an IT blog, we were able to grow deeply by sharing opinions with people with similar interests. In the third grade, students who are interested in coding and algorithms also participated in the study. It was an opportunity to solidify the foundations that were passed by the mentor activities on basic algorithms to those students. Also, based on that knowledge sharing, we were able to work as a team with business management friends in creative app classes, and we were able to derive a joint result of catching two rabbits, economic feasibility and technology called ""Drone Safe Homecoming APP."" ""Inconvenience, Driving the Development"" project was able to learn about the practical experience of using the framework and the use of SQL. By accessing the web page, we designed a program that allows information exchange in real time by making the written contents accessible from all users' screens. In addition, the drawing board function was added to explain the data structure together. In addition, the Spring framework MVC pattern was used and implemented as a responsive web. As a result, it was evaluated that information exchange is possible in an equal environment regardless of the device or the device they have, and they were able to win the Presidential Award upon completion of the undergraduate program. The experience of approaching the answer as a development rather than accepting the inconvenience will provide a foothold for the efficient management of IT projects at the Seoul Metropolitan Landfill Management Corporation. The system that manages illegal waste in advance by checking the type, amount brought in, and area of generated waste, and the system that manages the unloading and management of mobile-based waste by operating an IT-based integrated measuring stand, inspired enthusiasm for work. This is because I think it is a technology that considers not only convenience but also the safety of members of society. After joining the company, first, I will become a developing developer. I will participate in seminars and forums to study the latest IT technologies such as AI, cloud, and big data, and make efforts to build an innovative and convenient environment. Second, I will become a developer who suggests directions for improvement from various angles. We will explore more efficient algorithms of existing services and strive to provide services that are flexibly applicable to requirements. Based on these experiences, we will be reborn as a talented person who contributes to the development of the Seoul Metropolitan Landfill Management Corporation."
"My goal after joining the company is to establish a complete security system for network technology that will continue the next generation of 5G. As a generation that has used communication from the 2G era to the current 5G, I have always been interested in network technology that is closely related to my life. I have always looked at it, feeling the security issues that cannot be separated from him. In conclusion, I think it is necessary to innovate security technology according to the development of network technology. I applied for this job because I decided to follow the path accordingly. I would like to learn another language, including English and Japanese, which are my foreign language skills, within the next two years after obtaining an information security technology license. The purpose is to establish better security technology by interacting with talented people abroad based on solid background knowledge. In addition, I would like to work as another mainstay of KT in the team that establishes the foundation of a perfect security system within 10 years and implements it. I have experience working as an early member of a security club during college. As an early member, I tried to lay the foundation of the club and promote the new club. In addition, we did not miss gathering together in the club for security learning. For efficiency, we mainly recruited studies in the desired field and conducted learning by participating in them. I was interested in many fields and participated in a number of studies, and it was difficult to conduct many studies at the same time, but as a result, I realized that I could do anything with a firm mindset and effort. Thanks to the efforts of the early members, our club flourished day by day and held simple security competitions within the club. Unfortunately, however, since I graduated, the appearance of the club has changed a lot. Seeing this, I was able to realize that without a clear sense of goal, an organization that had already been created could deteriorate, and I was able to be alert again about myself. For two years during my master's course, I had the experience of developing and testing HEVC's CABAC encoder and decoder, one of the high-definition video codecs mainly used in the lab. Among them, the HEVC CABAC decoder was my main research field, and I developed IP as my master's graduation work and conducted it to MPW to write a thesis. For the first year, I learned the background knowledge necessary for research by helping the development and testing of the encoder like my senior, and for the second year, I studied and completed the development on my own. In addition, I was able to freely handle the basic necessary practical knowledge and document tools by managing the assignments in the lab, writing necessary materials, and conducting presentations, and various education and conferences I participated in, such as neuromorphic hardware courses for the realization of future artificial intelligence, gave me a lot of background knowledge and enlightenment. Such background knowledge and testing experience in video, practical experience in the lab, and experience in developing with seniors, will help me adapt quickly in KT, and I am confident that I will become a member of KT faster than anyone else."
"It was a job that I really wanted to do, and I applied because I wanted to work with you by learning more experience and know-how through the teachings of my seniors. It is because I thought it was a company that could fully demonstrate my ability and feel confident and rewarding to grow in a better way through the basic knowledge and expertise I learned in my major. Everyone wants to work in the field that they can do well and they like, and doing so will increase efficiency and bring results. That's why I applied for IBM Korea, where I can do and do what I like the most. It is to develop and operate the web application that the customer demands, and to develop, modify, and maintain systems such as JAVA-based web application and Mobile in the new system development and operation project. While majoring in IT, I gained a lot of knowledge, and I made several programs mainly using C language and JAVA. Programming using the JAVA language fits well with my personality, who likes a logical and systematic way of thinking. That's why I chose this path because I thought the programmer was suitable for my aptitude. I want to become an expert in the field of S/W development by learning the rapidly changing IT technologies these days. And I will continue to learn about the changing advanced IT technologies in the future, and even if I face a difficult situation, I will overcome it and achieve my goal to the end. I think it is necessary to have various skills and an open mind in order to survive in the ever-changing IT industry. I will be a developer who always studies and strives with the above abilities. I will be a talented person who will lead the growth of IBM Korea. I want to share the passion I want to do with IBM Korea. While majoring in IT, I gained a lot of knowledge, and I made several programs mainly using C language and JAVA. Converting it into a score, it is converted into 6.5 out of 10. I have worked on a C language-related project in my major subject called computer programming. It was a project to make a program that implements a puzzle of n*n array, and it was an experience that gave me a new function that others have not thought of other than the existing puzzle function. Due to the nature of the program development project, it was a task to refer to the existing source code, but never copy the same, and to produce it on your own. So, new variables were added in addition to the existing source code to facilitate the program's operation, new additional functions were added to make it possible to know the time and number of movements it takes to complete the puzzle, and a function to add a DOMISOL sound when completing the puzzle and to execute a warning sound when moving the puzzle in the wrong place was added. It was an experience that I tried in a new direction with a unique idea, and I received good marks for new functions when judging the completion of the project. In addition, I have experience working on JAVA-related projects in my major subject called smart device programming. I wrote to receive the type value of Hanoi tower and the number of disc using a scanner class, designed to move disc using a recursive algorithm, created a stack necessary for driving the Hanoi tower, and wrote various methods to move the disc. It made it implement the graphical element of the tower in Hanoi, and completed it similar to the actual tower game in Hanoi. I had enough time while I was working on my graduation work, but I wasn't ready at all. A total of three team members, myself included, shared their opinions, and with the advice of my advisor and the help of my lab assistant, I decided to select a topic called a drone flight system that applied LED-ID. I didn't know how to proceed, so I was really at a loss. However, all of the team members joined forces to start. It was my first time to experience video processing and embedded programming, and we proceeded by firmly sharing each other's roles. There were many cases where I stayed up all night until dawn to create works with the goal of completion, and there was a difficulty in finding necessary parts. Even during vacation, I came to the lab and proceeded with the project. Meanwhile, I became even more passionate when I first flew a drone into the sky. As a result, we were able to successfully display our work at the graduation exhibition, and all of the team members received a grade of A+. I was very happy that we achieved the goal of completion without having any equipment. Although it was an uncertain situation where the results could not be guaranteed, I think the experience achieved by challenging became an important asset for me in my future life. If I join IBM Korea, I will become an employee who sets goals and conducts my work in a challenging manner even in uncertain situations."
"He has been a curious child since he was young. I was able to answer questions without fail, and I have a habit of saying ""Why?"" This habit seems to have become the cornerstone for me to develop my creative problem-solving skills as an adult. I think it is a happy thing to have a solid goal in life, and I have lived a sincere life by putting my best efforts into everything to become a person who can take responsibility for my future since my school days. When I was a child, I admired the sky and made model airplanes. Since then, I have been working hard to achieve my dream of becoming an engineer. After going through middle and high school, where I liked to hang out with my friends, I was able to meet people and share my joy through various part-time jobs and club activities within the school. I think that the strength of my personality is that I have a positive mindset and an excellent eye for the whole flow. That's why I tend to learn and learn things quickly. I always work with a mindset that if I live with confidence, I can see the fruits I want, and when I take on a task, I do my best to handle it responsibly. I am calm and meticulous in my personality, so I tend to be careful in everything. I tend to be careful, so I'm misunderstood as an introvert, but I'm actually active, likes to make friends, and I have an active personality. The downside is that I lack a little seriousness and sometimes act lightly, but I'm trying to become a person who thinks twice before acting, and I'm also listening to the advice of my friends. I have a strong sense of responsibility, so I hate postponing my work until the next day, whether it's an appointment or a job that makes me stressed out if I couldn't finish a given day's work. In this respect, I may seem a little bit of a snobbish, but if I didn't have a snobbish side, wouldn't I have lost my ability to finish clearly and neatly? People who see me for the first time say that I have a clear argument and unexpectedly stubborn when I do team activities together. It's because I try to actively suggest opinions and it becomes a bit excessive, but I try to listen to others carefully to overcome it. While majoring in IT, I gained a lot of knowledge, and I also made several programs mainly using C language and JAVA. Among them, embedded programming was really interesting. The experience of programming on other hardware and temperature measurement sensor manufacturing using Arduino also interested me in the field of embeddedness. And I have experience in manufacturing LED board with the ability to display time using MCU(ATmega128), acquired expertise in voltage and current characteristics of passive element such as resistor, inductor, capacitor, and various circuit analysis techniques that can analyze circuit composed of DC power and passive element are understood by understanding filter characteristics by using frequency characteristics of passive element according to AC power, acquired in-depth knowledge of circuit analysis such as over-analysis by switch operation and circuit analysis method using Laplace conversion, studied the concept of semiconductor element and theory of circuit design, and experienced circuit design through regular practice using circuit design program (mainly Orcad-spice). In addition, while studying digital engineering, I developed the ability to understand, analyze and design digital circuits, started with code and Boolean algebra, and learned about the understanding and application of combination circuits, as well as the understanding and application of combination circuits, and digital electronic circuit design and optimization methods. I have experience in making a watch that lasts 24 hours using 7-SEGMENT after connecting the device directly to the breadboard by referring to the given circuit diagram using a breadboard and various IC devices. To understand the basic properties of VECTOR, COULOMB's law, full speed, GAUSS's law, electric energy, conductor and dielectric, capacitance, imaging current, and to understand the phenomena and applications of the electromagnetic field, the properties of current, the static magnetic field in vacuum, the force between magnetic field and current, the magnetic circuit, the electromagnetic induction phenomenon, the electromagnetic field, the motion, discharge phenomenon, and thermomagnetic radiation of charged particles were studied while studying electromagnetism. While studying wireless communication systems, I learned about the outline, technological trends, and technical specifications of various standardized wireless communication systems based on IEEE 802. I studied the basic theory and application of data communication. In particular, I studied the concepts and practices of various network technologies, including data link protocols, transmission media and transmission methods, multiplexing, coding, and error control methods. I practiced driving digital signal processing simulations using MATLAB. In the drone flight system using LED-ID, which was implemented as a graduation work, I used Raspberry Pi to adjust the speed of the motor and recognize the signals through the cell phone flash and light source. The experience of installing a camera module to attach it to the drone so that I can see the surrounding landscape on the screen and recognize the intensity of light. It was a pleasant experience for me to feel like I was gradually entering the machine as if I was peeling an onion. I was also interested in semiconductor jobs, so I took external education related to semiconductors, studied the contents of the eight major semiconductor processes and semiconductor process equipment. It was a job that I really wanted to do, and I applied because I wanted to work with your company and learn more experience and know-how through the teachings of my seniors. This is because I thought it was a company that could fully demonstrate my abilities and feel confident and rewarding to grow into a better shape through the basic knowledge and expertise I learned in my major. Everyone wants to work in a field they can do well and like, and doing so will increase efficiency and bring resultsThat's why I applied to your company where I can do the things I like the most. In addition, based on the experience of the entire company, I applied to your company with the ability and confidence to handle any tasks that are given. If I join the company, I will definitely try to become the person I need anywhere and do my best to make my abilities and qualities a driving force for your development. In addition, I will do my best in small things and always be a person who is recognized by anyone by doing everything with a learning attitude."
"In the early days of college, I vaguely avoided team projects after hearing only bad rumors about them. However, I realized that it was a weakness and rather took subjects that included team projects, such as an O(1) scheduler implementation project in the operating system subject and a landmine search design project using an FPGA board. In addition to classes, I wanted to make team projects my actual experience, such as participating in autonomous team projects in schools. As a result, I was able to get used to team activities and gain a lot of enlightenment such as presentation skills, communication skills within the team, and the efficiency of group activities based on the allocation of tedious tasks. I have been to OO before. I thought I had done enough preliminary research on the local area in Korea, but Nepal and the people living there showed a different appearance than I thought. Basically, language, diet, and culture were many different things, so I thought a lot about what to do to truly communicate with them. And I got a hint from the behavior of one of the team members. The team member was just talking to the children in Korean. Although real language did not work, I realized through this experience that my heart can be conveyed if there is a sincere effort to communicate. During the subsequent period, I also tried to share my feelings with each other in anything, and through that, I was able to gain a rewarding experience. When I wanted to go to graduate school, I faced my mother's opposition. I thought that in order to resolve my conflict with my mother and persuade her, I first needed to know what she really wanted, and I also felt that a lot of conversation with her was necessary. So, over the course of months, I had a deep conversation with my mother about this. Through this conversation, I was able to understand my mother's opinion in various aspects, not only the problem I encountered at the time, but also through various persuasions, she eventually opened up and allowed me to go to graduate school. Through this experience, I realized that time to share opinions in an organization is essential, and this was also an opportunity to broaden my understanding of how to achieve harmony in an organization through sharing opinions. I am a communicator. During my college life, I used my vacation to carry out continuous volunteer activities such as educational service, restaurant assistance, and management, and I have conducted team activities through on-campus work, club vice president, and short-term part-time jobs. Through this, I have gained a lot of experience in making friends with the members of the group and working toward a single goal. I am sure that this experience is my foundation."
"""Reading the World Expressed by Data"" Since childhood, I have tried to understand the importance of data and create value through it. When I was in high school, I witnessed many friends who were not interested in studying get scolded for running away during self-study time at night. As the class president at the time, I presented a probability model based on data called attendance book on whether a supervisor would come in. Based on this, they established an attendance strategy, and as a result, our class had the image that they were more eager to study than other classes. I went to the Department of Statistics according to the tendency to quantify reality and accurately judge it and suggest strategies. In the Department of Statistics, I was able to learn about various statistical theories and how to deal with data. However, I thought that there was a lot of lack of integration into the industry with only my knowledge of statistics, and by the fourth grade, I entered the OOO lab as an undergraduate research student. While the undergraduate program could only study structured data that existed in numbers, the lab could handle a lot of unstructured data. I was able to learn various methodologies for data analysis and analysis of things that were difficult to analyze objectively in the past, such as images and texts, and based on this, it was possible to find characteristics. LINE, a global company, aims to become a data scientist who deals with various kinds of data and creates meaningful value. ""A strong sense of ownership"" In addition to the given task, I work with a sense of ownership toward the group I belong to. I liked meeting new people, so I volunteered at the museum as a keeper of the exhibition room for a year. Visitors wanted to hear expert commentary, but the commentary time was set, so they often went back without hearing it. Looking at the people who were going back with regret, I thought that if I could let them know, I would have a better memory in the museum. Therefore, after studying about the exhibits personally, I kindly informed them whenever necessary. After the viewing in the museum, we conducted a survey, and many people mentioned thank you for the additional explanation. Through this, it has contributed to enhancing the image of the museum by being recognized by the commentator and the director. I will join LINE and have a higher sense of ownership than anyone else. In addition, based on this sense of ownership, I will build the trust of my colleagues and cooperate to bring out good results. ""Early adopter for Ideas"" In order to get new ideas, I read and organized the latest papers and explained them to my team members. When I was a senior at university, I belonged to OOO's laboratory and worked on many projects. Most of the research projects were done, and the purpose was to present new algorithms in the field of artificial intelligence. As an undergraduate researcher, when professors and seniors set a topic, I read and organized as many of the latest papers as possible. While sharing the data organized during the meeting, I explained the characteristics of each paper so that team members could quickly and easily understand it. In addition, new ideas were presented by fusion of the techniques used in the paper. By drawing a lot of inspiration from the latest papers, a new model could be developed, and good results were obtained by using new technologies in a different way."
"I have experienced many fields related to data, such as ""passion and diverse experiences in data analysis"" statistics and machine learning. I was able to learn about various statistical theories and how to deal with data in my major, the Department of Statistics. However, I thought that there were many shortcomings in applying only statistical knowledge to the industry, so I studied the field of machine learning on my own. In addition, not only theories but also various projects were carried out by entering the school's big data society. In addition to Kaggle's data set, I was able to crawl data existing on the web and apply methodologies learned while dealing with various types of data. By the fourth grade, I entered the OOO laboratory to experience a high-quality project closer to the field. There were many difficulties in living in the lab in parallel with the undergraduate class. In order to proceed with the project, master's and doctoral degrees had to study on their own the techniques they considered basic knowledge. I organized the minutes so as not to miss the meeting, and studied day and night without a weekend to participate in the project even a little more. Through this, I was able to learn various technologies that are not covered in undergraduate courses, such as heterogeneous data processing methods and natural language processing, and I was able to experience many projects. Based on these experiences and passion, I want to become a data scientist who creates value from data created by various services provided by Kakao. ""Early adopter for Ideas"" I constantly study to keep up with the latest trends in machine learning and deep learning, where new technologies continue to emerge. Belonging to OOO's laboratory, we developed a model to discriminate deepfake images. We needed a large amount of images to create a discriminant model, and we thought that the next generation of deep learning techniques called GAN (Generative Adversarial Network, 2014) could be utilized. Therefore, I looked up the latest papers related to GAN from influential societies such as ICML and NIPS, as well as search engines. We were able to find stable and high-performance algorithms, and we wrote a paper using them. Through this paper, we were able to win the Best Paper Award at OOO."
"I applied to Hummus-on to become a developer who communicates and makes a difference in the times. For the last 10 months, I have been working as a mentor at a mentoring group for college students to develop my communication skills. It was because I felt it was valuable to listen to someone and help them find their dreams. However, I realized that there was no finding my dream in that life, so I tried to become a developer of my dream again. I studied algorithms again from the programming language grammar that I had forgotten for a while. While taking the OO Online Jersey lecture, I studied BOJ problems with the goal of 3 questions a day. I have been studying continuously for more than 5 hours every day to establish my basic skills. When I was studying OOOO language, I was offered an internship in charge of website development and IT at the language school I attended. At that time, I was a new developer who only learned for 3 semesters, but I challenged because I was interested in a new job and didn't want to miss this opportunity. At first, I had never thought about web programming, so I started with only a passion for new development. After finishing class at the language school, I went to the IT department of the language school, Googling for 5 hours every day, watched daily coding videos, and studied web programming. Starting with the most basic HTML and CSS, I studied WordPress, which I used a lot at the time. As a result, I was able to study the basics of web programming for a year and develop my first ever website safely. 'Meeting' I express that I meet new things as well as people. I like to meet new people because I have a good affinity and I get to know them quickly. Also, I am very curious and like to meet new things. Whenever I meet new things in my daily life, I always analyze what technologies they are made of, and I like them because they stimulate my passion. There is a 'Trying' when I am hooked on one thing, I try to become passionate until I become passionate. When I was an undergraduate, when I first learned and did not understand the C language for the first time, I studied while attending a C language academy in Seoul until I worked part-time. I want to be a humble helper who makes a change of the times by meeting and communicating with new people at Hummus On with persistence."
"""How to Use Data"" How to use data determines the rise and fall of a company. Identifying the products that people want and buy, locating the items that are displayed, or deciding to sell are key points in distribution companies. Also, recently, people often see products to be purchased offline and purchase them online at an affordable price, and through this, we have to understand people's needs. I think this job has the potential to develop in the future because digital is the most effective way to grasp data. As a consumer who actually purchases goods online, when I purchase goods, I receive a recommendation notice on the distribution company's website stating that it is the 'perfect product for you'. I often purchase more goods from them because I understood my needs. Looking at this, I applied as a digital job to use my major to understand the needs of customers and to increase the competitiveness of the company. My life has changed after reading the book ""Miracle Morning, Change My Life"" and ""Miracle Morning."" I was living a normal life without much standing out. Then, just before I was discharged from the military, I happened to read a book called Miracle Morning. The content of the book was about waking up in the morning, investing an hour in self-improvement, gaining the initiative in life, and achieving what you want. I thought it was a necessary part for me, who became a habit of sleeping late. So, I woke up at 6 a.m. from March and invested 15 minutes in stretching, chin-ups, reading books, and diary. I wanted to take both my body and mind to the next level. After being discharged from the military, I practiced consistently and felt that my efforts were shining. As my physical strength improved and my mind became comfortable, I felt that my work was going well. As my graduation work, I produced RC cars using LeapMotion with my team members, participated in a competition, and received both a Popularity Award and an Encouragement Award in recognition of its novel input device. In addition, I obtained an electrician license with a passing rate of about 10 percent, and was able to graduate with a credit of 4.38 in the last semester. Increasingly, I felt that I was becoming a person who could do what I decided to do. ""Sound Love, Acoustic Band Club."" The part that I am most interested in other than studying is music. I have been an acoustic band club ever since I entered university. I was the vocalist and keyboard in the band, and performed regularly, on festival stages, and on the street to college once a semester. In December 2015, my brother got married and asked my clubmates if I could sing in the wedding. They all liked to perform, so I readily agreed. So, I met them every weekend during the semester and practiced for about a month and a half before singing. It was the second semester of my third year, so I was really grateful that all of my classmates practiced together even though they were busy. My parents, brother, and I were happy, so the wedding day was the best and the most memorable moment of my life. For me, my brother's wedding day was a day when I realized my life goals small. I was unable to help financially because I was a college student, but I was able to congratulate him as much as I could through club activities during my college life. In this way, my goal is to become a person who benefits people around me with my ability, and now I want to benefit people professionally through digital jobs. ""RC Cars Using LeapMotion, Transferring Wireless Data with Pyhton"" We started producing graduation works with the aim of winning the contest in October. We implemented the project with a group of three members, and decided to produce a 2WD RC car using LeapMotion. The work was to control the motor after sending the input received through LeapMotion to Raspberry Pi via wireless communication. Since we used two wheels, we implemented directional change using the speed difference between the wheels. I was in charge of Socktprogramming to send LeapMotion's DATA to Raspberry Pi here. The language used Python, and the slope of the bottom of the hand was divided into X-axis and Y-axis to send data, implementing the common speed of each wheel and the additional speed of each wheel. These data were required at the same time, and they were transmitted in a matrix through Packaging, and then unpackaged again and transmitted to Raspberry Pi. These data were used to control the PWM signal of the Arm processor connected to Raspberry Pi, and there was one problem. As the motor rotated, the data transmitted from the input end was broken. When I checked the data through debugging, only the high data was output with 0xFFFF. As a result of studying the motor to determine the cause, the problem was that back electromotive force was generated as the motor rotates, which collides with the existing data. So, noise was removed by adding a Bypass filter to the motor, and the problem could be solved. ""The distant viewer wins."" Those who have a clear long-term goal are more likely to overcome difficulties than those who do not, and the work efficiency is higher because they know the direction. During the internship period, I would like to find out the customer's data regarding distribution. I would like to build customized data through the products that customers decide to purchase, the products that they clicked on but did not purchase, the reason why, and the services that identify frequently purchased items and provide them to customers. In addition, within the next five years, we will figure out how to attract overseas customers by grasping data on overseas customers using DB construction capabilities and English capabilities, which are advantages. And in 10 years, I will be in charge of building Lotte's own strong distribution network through the human network I have built up and nurturing juniors."
"As I became a third grader in the ""Electronic Circuit, Pulse Measurement Project,"" I took an electronic circuit class that I wanted to listen to, and I came to produce a pulse measurement circuit as a practical practice. It is largely composed of three stages: the sensor unit, the filter unit, and the amplifier unit. The sensor unit recognized the pulse rate using the male and female light emitting units, and the filter unit used the Op-amp to construct a bandpass filter. In the last amplification unit, the signal of the weak pulse was amplified. I was able to develop my ability to see the whole circuit, and I was able to study the principle of recognizing the pulse. One year of Struggle, Motor Control"" The project was carried out by a group of three and decided to manufacture a 2WD RC car using LeapMotion. Since I used two wheels, I thought I should change direction by using the difference in speed of the wheels. So, I chose to send data by dividing the slope of the palm into the X-axis and the Y-axis, and since I needed these data at the same time, I transmitted it to the matrix through Packaging and utilized it again. The input of LeapMotion enabled motor control, but the duration was about 5 seconds. As a result of thinking about the cause, noise generated by rotating the brush motor distorted the input. After checking this with an oscilloscope, the Bypass filter stage was constructed using capacitors and inductors accordingly. While solving this problem, I wanted to give up in the middle, but the fact that the team members agreed to make sure to solve the problem was a big driving force. As a result, I went to the competition and won both the Excellence Award and the Encouragement Award. ""Impedance Measurement Circuit"" As an intern, I worked on a project to make a human impedance measurement circuit and print it to a PC. It measures the impedance of a human body by applying a sin wave (constant current source) of 100 kHz. The entire process was in the order of business plan, system block diagram, circuit design, material order, PCB layout order, soldering, debugging, and firmware design. The circuit is largely composed of a power supply part, a signal generator, and a measurement circuit. First, the human body can die if more than 50 mA of ventricular fibrillation current flows, so the primary side and the secondary side are insulated from each other by a switching regulator and a transformer at the power supply part. And as an output, the positive voltage and negative voltage of ±5V were created. The signal generator applied a PWM signal from the MCU and generated a sin wave through the third LPF to generate a signal, which was converted into a current through a V-I converter to implement a constant current source. Since noise is applied to the signal by noise from the switching regulator and noise from external fluorescent lights in the measurement circuit afterwards, a full-wave rectification circuit and LPF were implemented and applied to the ADC to obtain the average value. The ADC and MCU exchanged data through SPI communication, and the MCU and PC output the impedance measured through UART communication through the PC."
"The criteria that I choose a company is its management style and vision. 'A company that creates value by increasing customer confidence through customer-centered innovation.' I believe that the value of a company is created by its customers, and Hana Financial TI, which approaches with a customer-centered mind based on customer trust, is the ideal management method of the company. This was a big reason for me to choose Hana Financial TI. When I first decided to become a developer, my ultimate goal was to see as many people as possible use the programs I have contributed to conveniently. Financial services are a service that always exists next to one person, but financial services are a service that always exists firmly to one person, and I want to become a digital financier by contributing to the development of programs that each customer needs. As above, my goal after joining the company is to create a program that many people use comfortably and pleasantly. I want to become the best developer who provides the best services to customers with the flow and understanding of the process I learned while using financial programs. Due to my timid personality when I was a child, I often did not even try many things I wanted to do, but as I grew up, I decided to change my personality and tried to live a positive and challenging life because I thought that if I lived a passive life and hid myself, I would be able to do nothing. I have always lived in a challenging and passionate attitude. I have had many experiences, and I would like to talk about myself through two of them. I had a tablet, and it was a model that did not support versions 2.3 or later through OS upgrades. Later version 4.0 came out, and I wanted to use the new version, but as soon as I was thinking about buying a new tablet, I searched the Internet, wondering if there was any other way to use it. Then I saw an article that 4.0 version could be used with my Galaxy Tab if I distributed it within an Internet cafe and manually updated it through loading. Although loading was not illegal, I realized that A/S support was not possible after I did it, but I thought it was necessary to improve the speed, so I put it into action. ""Dieting is not just about changing your appearance."" Until high school, the word ""obesity"" was always a word that never left me. Being obese often hurt my peers and others. During the winter vacation of my second year of high school, I set a goal of losing 20 kilograms through diet control while exercising. The fruit of success was really sweet. I have made friends with friends I have always liked, and I have realized the importance of self-care in other people's attitudes before. There is a saying that a person with a heavy butt is a winner. Of course, sitting for a long time does not mean good things, but good things come when you work with persistence. This requires physical strength. It consumes a lot of physical strength both when studying and working, so it requires physical strength. I want to become a person who shines through persistent efforts based on my physical strength. I believe that the physical fitness I am currently doing is not only about external changes but also the foundation that will help me build my skills and capabilities, and I am working hard and will continue to train without giving up. Being passionate and challenging anything is not always the right attitude. It may be an impossible reckless challenge or a challenge that adversely affects me, but I tried to make a change with the idea that 'it is better to do it and regret it than not do it and regret it'. Among the sites run by the university, there is a site called the industry-academic management system. There are many subjects in the engineering college class that work on projects in connection with companies, and they are subjects that work on projects through thematic matching with companies. I am currently in charge of maintaining and repairing a homepage called the industry-academic management system, which is used to match topics with companies and report projects with other student developers. It is being developed using node.js, and it is playing a role in developing new menus or functions that users such as professors or companies want, or correcting errors. Recently, we have been working on making manuals for students, professors, and mentors who are using this site for the first time, and are preparing to renew the site to provide more convenient services. This project is planned to be in charge by this year, so I will take responsibility for it until I find and hand it over to a trusted successor. Through the above experience, I was able to learn how to deal with specific plans and structures before starting the project, and learn the importance of exchanging work and knowledge through Github and Slack with my team members. In addition, I gained programming skills through practical work and gained confidence that I could solve difficult tasks by performing tasks without giving up with persistence. Lastly, I was encouraged to overcome without worrying about future tasks. It is difficult to perform tasks skillfully from the beginning, but I am confident that I will become a talented person who can perform well at Hana Financial TI if I overcome difficulties with a challenging spirit and passion."
"""Importance of Efforts Learned by Swimming"" Since August 2018, I have been swimming for 1 hour every day from 8 o'clock to maintain a regular life and health. At first, it was quickly exhausting and difficult, but seeing people who are good at swimming made me want to do better. Thus, I was corrected for my swimming posture by the elderly who became close to me in the pool. However, when I couldn't swim well, I looked for related videos and studied them. As a result, it was difficult to complete the 50m-long swimming pool track at first, but I was able to do six laps without stopping. I learned through swimming that I need the 'right mind' and 'strength' to get through something. With the idea of 'When does the end of the track come?' you cannot fully concentrate on swimming, and the end of the track is a new beginning, so you may soon get tired of it. I learned that the mindset when doing a certain task is not waiting for the end, but to immerse yourself in the process. Also, I think what makes it possible is the strength that you have built up so far, namely effort. I lacked muscle strength in both swimming and life. But now, I am working hard to acquire the programming and data management skills necessary for the SW Engineering job every day. Even if I join SK C&C, I will not judge it as the completion of the track and become an employee who develops muscle strength in a new process. I participated in a mentoring program that teaches Korean to foreigners ""to achieve communication without language."" My mentee was a Chinese named 'OOO.' My problem was that he didn't know Korean and English. I also don't know Chinese, so when I told the person in charge that I can't communicate with the mentee, the person in charge can give up, but if I cancel once, I told the Chinese friend that there will be no additional chance to match. After thinking hard, I decided to spend one semester with him. I wanted to be helpful to him who will learn Korean alone in another country. Since then, my friend and I have met twice a week to communicate and teach text using a translator app. My friends who found out that they were teaching Korean to foreigners through a translator said that it was absurd, but it was difficult for me that it took more time than I looked around me. It was because it took more than twice as long to teach, so I had a lot of difficulty in parallel with my studies. I was able to finish the semester safely as a result of trying to continue mentoring while reducing break time and sleep. I was able to learn the weight of responsibility and the power of communication. I learned that if I have to take responsibility for my job, I should communicate voluntarily and actively for problem solving and improvement rather than being scared and giving up. Through the above experience, I will demonstrate my communication skills and community spirit at SK C&C, which pursues shared growth with customers. Completion of the Java application SW developer training course based on algorithm and data structure In order to improve my skills with enthusiasm for programming languages such as Java and Oracle DB, I wrote the class content plan by myself, and I tried to improve my programming skills by investing 3 hours a day consistently outside of the course study hours conducted by the educational institution. After the training, I created OOO service with my team members by devising a project to apply web technologies and CRUD techniques such as Ajax and Spring Framework. Acquisition of Information Processing Technician Certification In parallel with national strategic industry vocational training, I took the first information processing technology test in 2018. Writing was memorized and understood using school hours, and practical skills were able to acquire knowledge of a wide range of submissions by submitting questions using the study and the console of the eclipses. Through this experience, I was able to improve my understanding of new technology trends, algorithms, and DBs, and I was qualified as an information processing technician."
"The challenge is 'to shine when effort is accompanied'. I have the experience of learning that a challenge without effort cannot be successful. In the second half of 2017, I failed in the challenge of finding a job. I judged that the problem was that I did not constantly search to understand the company and job, and that I was not faithful to credit management, which is the duty of college students. Things that I did not try hard came back as a result of being eliminated from the job market. Only then could I learn the simple truth that people who have worked hard and prepared for it can seize opportunities through challenges. ■ Efforts for re-challenge ■ In 2018, I decided to develop my job competency based on failure. Before increasing my expertise, I was able to decide on the goal of 'IT Architect' by analyzing various jobs and asking myself what I wanted to do. For this, I completed an 800-hour SW developer training course for the purpose of improving my expertise, and took the information processing engineer test during training and passed. I was able to achieve good results when I put the plans to achieve the goal of acquiring IT skills into action. By continuously studying, I have achieved the challenge of acquiring a programming language for six months. With the spirit of challenge accompanied by hard work, I will become an engineer who makes small differences in ICT development and operation jobs. ■ Success story ■ In the '****' subject I took in 15, I conducted a project with two men and women I met for the first time. One day, during the meeting, the female member expressed her negative opinion directly on the contents of the male member's investigation, which cooled the mood. I hurriedly settled the issue that had to be decided at the meeting and broke up the meeting. Believing that communication between the members must take place first in order to conclude the project smoothly, I called her separately to talk about the problems and suggested meeting him and apologize to achieve the project's goals. Fortunately, the relationship between the members, which could have gone against the beginning of the project, was restored. As a result, the presentation of the project was able to proceed safely. ■ Failure story ■ I have participated in a project to participate in an overseas tour program in 2014. Fortunately, we were able to get to know each other easily even though it was our first time seeing each other, so the atmosphere of the meeting was very comfortable and we were able to proceed freely. However, the output was not good enough. The topic was not decided until a few days later, and as a result, it was not selected for the program due to insufficient data research and PPT writing. ■ Collaboration should be based on a clear goal ■ It was the most difficult to propose an apology to female members in projects in class, while it was the most difficult to decide on a topic in overseas exploration projects. The projects with high intimacy failed, but I think the reason why we were able to achieve the best results in projects with close intimacy was because of communication on the premise of achieving the goal of collaboration. Rather than forgetting the purpose of collaboration and just enjoying the meeting, I could learn that collaboration can be successful when goal achievement takes precedence over communication. Through the SW knowledge accumulated in IT education and the variable management skills acquired by majoring in industrial management engineering, I can demonstrate my strengths directly or indirectly in the job. While working on a project to develop a homepage during the programming language curriculum, one of the team members suddenly gave up the training with one week left before the presentation. We agreed to re-establish the schedule after the meeting to complete the project. I, who was in charge of scheduling, wrote a flow schedule for page construction and package integration using Gant chart, and through this, I was able to give additional roles to each team. As a result of thoroughly fulfilling each role according to the re-established schedule, it was recognized through the presentation that our team submitted a high-quality project even though there were vacancies. I think my competitiveness is the ability to manage variables, including scheduling ability, along with the IT knowledge that played a part in the development of the project. In addition, the experience of practicing ERP through industrial engineering experiment classes can be helpful in developing and operating related IT systems. This is because developers or managers can show a high understanding of developing related systems when they have actually used SW. I will show my strengths in the job through IT knowledge and industrial management engineering experience. It is an essential vision because the competencies required according to the changing times are SMART and CREATIVE. It is the ability required of us in the face of the 4th Industrial Revolution, where machines replace humans and technological development is taking place at a rapid pace. It cannot be replaced by SMART, artificial intelligence, and deep learning that can quickly adapt and apply new technologies, and Hanwha System ICT can develop with CREATIVE that can only be exercised by humans. I have experience in deciding the theme of the club through the ideas I suggested. In order to solve the problem that the club I visited again after serving in the military turned into an unidentified group, I constantly searched the Internet and searched for books in the library. As a result, I was able to propose an idea derivation technique called brainwriting through a book called 'Exciting Debate'. As a result of conducting the meeting through the relevant discussion method, it was reborn as a 'Team Competition Discovery and Support' club that can satisfy the majority of members by adding a number of ideas. If I had simply suggested an idea for a new topic, I would not have made the best choice necessary for deciding the topic of the club. Through this experience, I learned that a CREATIVE idea can be demonstrated as SMART through constant effort. I will take the lead in the development of the ICT sector of the Hanwha system by demonstrating creativity through constant learning."
"I had a presentation on IT issues when I was a third grader in college. There were various presentations such as IoT, drone, virtual reality, and augmented reality, and I presented them under the theme of FinTech and Insure Tech. While doing research, I learned that many of the latest IT technologies are applied to the financial sector, and I was very attracted to the fact that IT technologies are combined with finance to create something new. In particular, WooriFIS is an ICT company that developed the first mobile messenger in the financial sector, Wibitok, and the first mobile bank in Korea, Wibitank, and obtained three international quality certifications for development, operation, and security. I want to join WooriFIS as a financial IT expert to become the world's No. 1 ICT company. My goal after joining the company is to analyze customers' needs and develop IT services like Wibitok, which has functions that differentiate it from existing chat apps such as 'Pung Message' and 'Message Recovery'. When I was in college, I worked on a project called '3D For Kids'. At that time, I saw an Internet article titled ""The Efficiency of Writing English Word Education"", and I wondered if there was a solution, and based on the augmented reality technology of the app called ""Pokemon Go"", I developed a mobile application that combines augmented reality and English word education. The main functions were word recognition through the camera, 3D image output, inventory that can collect and inquire English words, and card games that use the collection function. Thanks to this, I received the excellent prize at the 'SW Project Performance Presentation'. With these capabilities, I will participate in the advancement of our fiasco into a global financial IT company. ""Confidence gained through perseverance"" When I was a freshman in college, I had a hard time learning C++ programming for the first time. I wondered if I could go along with the class after I was discharged from the military, but I thought of hitting it once, and took a course called programming application and design. However, there was a situation in the middle of the semester that I couldn't touch it due to difficult tasks. Looking at my senior who submitted assignments that felt only difficult, I thought not to repeat my freshman's mistakes. I gradually completed the function by studying SQL, socket communication, and MySQL databases. After two weeks, I submitted the assignment, but the professor gave me a positive view of me, who did not give up and did the assignment until the end. I gained confidence that I could do it, and it was an experience that gave me a great opportunity to improve my programming skills. In the third grade, I took on the role of the team leader while working on a OOO project. The completion of the development you suggested was over 60%, but our group aimed at 90%. However, it took a lot of time to write the specifications and designs, so the development deadline was just around the corner. With the idea of doing my best as a team leader, I studied MySQL, JSP, JavaScript, and MVC models all night through Internet materials and books, and developed my functions first. I completed it by asking questions about the parts I did not know through e-mail to an incumbent web developer, and I was able to develop the functions each of the team members by referring to the functions. Thanks to my persistent efforts, I was able to feel great trust from my team members and the joy of the development project. ""New Trend-Insure Tech"" As the latest IT technologies have been combined with finance, many financial IT services, including voice recognition services using AI, biometric recognition, and non-face-to-face services, have been released. However, the domestic insurance market has not changed much. In the era of the 4th industrial revolution, consumers have become smart as IT experience and knowledge accumulate, and the insurance market is also rapidly changing as various technologies develop. Lemonade, an American insurance startup, uses artificial intelligence technology to provide services that are in charge of insurance claims and recommend consumer personalized products based on big data. In addition, Progressive, an American insurance company, provides a service that reduces insurance costs when driving safely by analyzing customers' driving habits, such as sudden braking, total driving distance, and driving date. Customers think that the market will no longer be a passive role in receiving insurance services, but an active role in reducing the likelihood of accidents, so that insurers and customers can win-win with each other. In addition, if large IT companies such as Amazon invest in InsureTech and enter the insurance industry, I think that basic insurers will also apply IT technologies such as blockchain and big data to their businesses, which will intensify competition among companies. I once worked on a OOOO project when I was in university ""to do the best in each role."" As I was working on the development project for the first time, there were technical difficulties, and the team members remained in school for a long time due to personal reasons, so I couldn't have a team meeting. I thought it was necessary to divide the roles accurately, and through the team meeting, the system to be developed was divided into detailed functions and each part to be in charge of was selected. I developed hypermarket location inquiry, Beacon communication, data DB storage function, and parking location recommendation logic. In addition, we updated the code and development document by using the GitHub shape management tool, and we were able to complete the project within the period. Thanks to the team members' respective roles, we were able to receive the Excellence Papers Award at the Korea Computer Science Conference. I have experience in designing a database of ""constant communication."" Analyzing and designing the materials close to 10 pages of A4 was not easy for all of our team members. We had several team meetings because we thought that if we took the wrong direction in the first stage, a bigger problem might arise later on. However, even if the meeting continued, the opinions of the six people were so different that it was difficult to combine them into one opinion. I thought it was caused by not understanding the theoretical concept accurately, so I suggested that we record the professor's lecture and study again. As I studied the book and lecture again, I corrected the misunderstanding through the meeting.Thanks to this, I was able to receive the highest score among the 12 teams during the first presentation and receive praise from the professor. While taking a leave of absence, I worked as a lecturer at a programming academy. As I was working hard for the first time, I had difficulty teaching children. It was not easy to explain even grammar that could be easily understood at the children's level. I recalled a time when I had difficulty with coding, and studied again from the basics while thinking about what was confusing from the children's point of view. Thanks to this, I was able to proceed with the lecture safely. There will be many shortcomings as a new employee in our FIS. However, with the idea of learning again like this, I will work hard to become a talented person who constantly communicates with my seniors."
"""Electronic dream tree starts with electronic dream tree ends with programmer"" When I was in middle and high school, I preferred math and physics. Among them, I was particularly interested in electricity and electronics, so I went to the electronic engineering department. There, I met C programming for the first time. Among the first-year subjects of the electronic engineering department, except for C programming, there were quite a few things that overlapped with what I learned in high school. As a result, I was able to devote most of my study time to C programming, and I achieved the highest grade in class. I became interested in programming and started studying it in the second grade after I joined the military. I studied C++ and Visual C++ (MFC) in my major, laying the foundation for programming, and experienced programming in various environments such as ATmega and Unix to develop my dream of becoming a programmer. In addition to the required subjects, I developed my personal competence in programming while completing all the elective courses related to programming, and I became more confident, so I was fully in charge of programming for various projects during the semester. However, when I became a senior and experienced more difficult projects and participated in a contest, I felt that I needed experience to develop my overall knowledge and skills in programming in addition to my studies. In the second semester of my fourth year, I took a developer training curriculum at OOOOO in parallel with my studies. There, I was able to learn about various programming languages, embedded systems, and web programming, and I constantly tried to take one step forward by studying separately. Since then, I have been able to complete education at the same time as I graduated from college, and once again, I have strengthened my will to dream of becoming a programmer. ""There is no rough draft in my dictionary."" When I get interested in a specific area, I usually look for everything from one to ten when I look for something, or when I buy something related. As a result, I have never skimmed over when I look for something, so I often become knowledgeable in many ways and inform others. This personality is similar when I study or deal with something. When I'm immersed in one task or problem, I tend to hold onto it until I'm done with it, and while I'm working on that one task, I can concentrate so well that I don't look back on another task. If this applies to my personality and my job as a software developer, I think I can achieve good results for my job. ""Triple A-type boy, become a caring icon."" My weakness is that I think I am an introvert. I was careful to talk to strangers and friends of the opposite sex, so I was able to get out of my head all kinds of simulations about how to do not feel pressured and offended the other person. However, as I entered the school year, I often couldn't talk to people I wanted to get close to or friends I like, and I was so frustrated that I decided to change my personality. After that, I joined the broadcasting department in high school and the student council in college, and constantly tried to change my personality to an extrovert by communicating with many people. As I continued my club activities, my fear disappeared when I first talked to the first person I saw, but strangely, I became more careful about not only words but also actions, and being considerate of the other person became a habit. As a result, I became recognized as a person who knows how to be considerate of others, and after that, I naturally put ""thinking and caring attitude for the other person"" as a lifestyle, and I was able to improve my shortcomings a lot. The reason I chose the job of S/W development among various jobs is that development is more helpful than any other study, and it was very good that the more I did it, the more I gained various perspectives as I gained experience, and the greater the sense of accomplishment I gained as much as I tried. I went to the university with OO engineering, but I studied hard because programming that I encountered for the first time was more interesting than any other subject. As the grade went up, I came across various languages, and my interest in programming grew even more, and naturally my skills improved. As a result, while working on a joint task, I was in charge of writing the source code that other people had difficulty with, and I was able to clearly determine my career path by always taking full charge of the programming part when I made a specific program or was working on a project. After deciding on my career path, I have done competitions, internet lectures, and completion of educational institutions in order to further develop my capabilities. In the second semester of my third year of college, I had a field training at a place called OOOO for two months. My task there was to develop an open-source wearable development kit called HEXIWEAR, which measures heart rate and body temperature to prevent cardiac arrest patients, and to develop an algorithm that automatically alerts the paramedics when a suspected cardiac arrest value occurs. I spent the first month or so interpreting open sources of functions necessary to develop a cardiac arrest patient prevention algorithm, and spent the other month developing actual algorithms. Because HEXIWEAR's open source was a high-level code to interpret in my ability at the time, it was difficult to interpret, and there were difficulties in developing actual algorithms. However, I found these courses interesting and it gave me a chance to work as a developer. I think I can tell you the language I learned while I was in college and the language I learned in an educational institution before graduation. I learned C, C++, and Linux programming in college, and I learned Python, Java, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in an educational institution. Among them, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were learned together when I was doing web programming through the Django module in Python, and I also learned both Jackie and Ajax.In addition, I have experienced MySQL and MongoDB as DBMS, I have used MySQL on both Windows and Linux, on the console on Linux, and as a workbench on Windows. MongoDB was not learned, but I used it separately while working on a project, and I used it in conjunction with Python. Additionally, I have overall knowledge of the network. In college, I took more than two related courses and have an information processor license as a proof material. Also, although I am not related to cloud services, I have used YOLO, a deep learning-based object recognition algorithm. Let me tell you about my experience in the project. 1. C language project experience: - Sensors such as Raspberry Pi and Arduino, module control - Simple console game (Halligali) - Image processing programming using OPENCV Level of thinking by itself: Intermediate 2. C++ Project experience: - Game using MFC (Catchmind) - Image processing programming using OPENCV Level of thinking by itself - Image processing programming using Qt Widget programming Level of thinking by itself: Medium and low 3. Python project experience: - Creating a personal site using the Django framework - HTTP web communication using the Django framework - Interworking with Mongo DB - Intermediate 4. Java project experience: - Android game application (Gugudang) Level of thinking by itself: - Medium and low 5. HTML project experience: - Creating a personal site in conjunction with Python Level of thinking by itself: - Level 6. CSS project experience: - Level of thinking about creating a personal site in conjunction with Python Level of thinking: Level 7. JavaScript project experience: - Use with QML in Qt Quick application & HTTP web communication by itselfYour Excellency's rating: While working on various projects at mid- to low-level universities, I learned that there was a subject related to algorithms and learned that it was important to create code efficiently and to be able to use algorithms. Later, I started studying algorithms with my classmates at an educational institution related to programming that I attended before graduating from college. The main code for learning algorithms was Java, and I studied algorithms for two hours three times a week for three months from September to November. The goal of learning algorithms was not to solve only problems but to develop effective algorithm thinking skills, so I used a method of solving problems, looking at each other's codes, and finding more effective ways through discussion. Since it was more effective to teach others what I learned than to study alone, I explained the parts that I had studied separately and pointed out the wrong parts. Based on what I had studied, I volunteered to explain algorithms or concepts that were a little difficult within the study and to interpret the code, and I also led the atmosphere when the students were struggling in difficult parts. While learning the algorithm, I was able to develop my judgment ability to find the best function for a specific situation, and I also explained it to the study people by giving examples. In addition, while solving algorithm problems, I was able to feel the close relationship between coding and mathematics. For example, it can be easily solved by using repetitions in a code that requires the sum of numbers listed in turn, but the larger the number of numbers, the less efficient it is, so using the sum formula of the equal sequence, the more efficient the time complexity could be achieved. While working on the study, I learned responsibility through my leading role, and gained a passion for studying the algorithm, the desire to experience it in a language other than C and Java rose, and I have since tried to increase my algorithmic ability by encountering various problems through algorithm problem sites. I promise that this accumulated algorithmic ability and thinking ability can be an excellent developer of the S/W development department that requires problem-solving ability and creative problem-solving ability using various programming languages."
"IT in the era of the 4th industrial revolution will break the boundaries of hardware based on high-tech technologies such as big data, artificial intelligence, and the Internet of Things, and have a great impact on overall life. In particular, in the fields of aviation, logistics, and finance, where huge amounts of data processing and high level of accuracy are essential, I think how well you use IT technology will act as a factor in determining the leading companies in the industry. I want to be reborn as an IT expert in the future based on my basic knowledge of computer science in general and my experience with various projects including graduation works, which I learned while majoring in computer science. Asiana IDT, which is actively investing in various high-tech fields such as big data, blockchain, and artificial intelligence with the aim of becoming No. 1 in the industry, is an excellent company for me to be reborn as an IT expert in the era of the 4th industrial revolution. As we enter the era of the 4th industrial revolution, if high-tech IT technologies such as big data, artificial intelligence, and blockchain are applied to aviation fields where accuracy and time compliance are prioritized, it will bring great efficiency to operation. I want to join Asiana IDT and gain experience in high-tech fields in line with the rapidly changing times. By participating in the construction of various advanced solutions, I would like to contribute to Kumho Asiana Group's rebirth as a No. 1 company in aviation and logistics by becoming an expert for 10 years. I applied for the job of system development and operation, and while majoring in computer science, I became interested in the field of system development and operation. Based on the basic knowledge of computer science that has been steadily built up along the curriculum of my major for four years, I have worked hard on algorithms that allow me to process various data and create effective output. Based on the project capabilities and insights on data analysis gained through this experience, I think that if I join Asiana IDT, I will be able to participate in various system development and operation. When I was an undergraduate, I was able to build and operate a website as a final project while taking the Web System Design course, and I planned a website for people who raise pets after a long discussion with my team members with the goal of realizing a really useful website beyond simple tasks. I felt that I was very short on time to proceed with the project while working at school because I included various services for usefulness. However, rather than reducing the function, I was able to complete the project smoothly as a result of adjusting the schedule with the team members, sharing the development with my own parts, and reinforcing the knowledge through active research on the necessary parts. When I was taking a subject called Critical Thinking and Discussion, I was able to discuss the pros and cons of the future of artificial intelligence. At that time, all the members of the group who were preparing for the discussion were majoring in the humanities and social sciences, so they had difficulty understanding the principles and characteristics of artificial intelligence. However, since it was the time when the final exam was in full swing, there was a limit to studying the concept of artificial intelligence. Since childhood, I have kept in mind the belief that I should study and leave others, and I have produced materials using my major knowledge to share with the team members. Thanks to this, I was able to split my time and use it to prepare for the final exams in other subjects, but the experience of using my knowledge to help others remains impressive."
"""School Award: Teaching, Learning, and Growing Together"" When I was a second grader, I had experience building a school in Laos with the architectural experience I learned during my military service. During my military service, I worked at various architectural sites such as recovering from typhoon damage and creating parks. While performing this task, I felt proud that my skills could be helpful to society, and I set a goal to practice them in society as well. Even after being discharged from the military, I periodically engaged in architectural service, and in 2014, I was able to perform architectural service in Laos. In addition, I was able to serve as a mentor for juniors while working as an assistant in my major class. Through these experiences, I was able to share learning and compensate for my shortcomings. I think I can exert my true value when I can share learning and contribute to society. I also want to actively learn from SK Chemicals and contribute to the team, company, and society. ""Field experience + Knowledge = Improvement"" I would like to be in charge of improving the production system based on my understanding of SCM in IT planning team. To this end, I have gained production field experience, production plan, and SCM-based knowledge. First, it is field experience. I was able to improve my understanding of ERP and the site while carrying out the shipment management work at the factory. For the final shipment, I managed the processes of each department, from manufacturing instructions to raw material purchase requests to post-production test requests, and in this process, I was able to think about how to establish an optimal production system. Second, I deepened my understanding of SCM by obtaining a CPIM certificate in addition to my major subjects. In this process, I learned the production process from establishing a production plan to MRP for ordering materials and requesting purchase. In addition, I was able to understand the flow of resources inside and outside the organization by approaching the demand forecast to purchase strategy in a large framework, and I was able to develop an eye for production from the perspective of the company as a whole. In addition, I was able to think about the terms and inventory management techniques used in practice. Based on this, I promise to set the goal of 'improving SK Chemical's production system and shortening lead time' and achieve it. I have the experience of obtaining a certificate in the third test after challenging the excavator driver's certificate ""The infinite possibility learned through excavator."" While working as a facility manager during my military life, I went to various work sites, and I challenged for a certificate because I felt the utility of an excavator. With no driving experience, I was rejected in two consecutive tests due to my poor equipment manipulation. To overcome this, I first looked back on what I lacked. At the center of it was a complacent thought that ""because my colleagues around me easily acquire it."" In addition, I was able to realize that I was inexperienced in lever manipulation during work. To compensate for this, I asked the driver for help, went to work 30 minutes early every day, and practiced together while leaving work late. In addition, with the mindset of 'I can do it', I recorded and supplemented my shortcomings every day, and as a result, I was able to pass the third test. I have accurately grasped my current skills, and I think I was able to pass as a result of supplementing them. Through this experience, I gained confidence that I can do anything with a goal and tenacity. I will show you that SK Chemicals does not give up and does my job until the end."
"I want to challenge and develop with Hanwha, which is making a leap into a global company. I read an article that ranked 23rd in the 'Global Defense Company' rankings compiled by the U.S. defense industry magazine last year. I believe that Hanwha System is playing a key role in the center of Hanwha's defense sector, which has shown itself to be the best defense company not only in Korea but also in Asia. Hanwha Systems produces defense products based on IT and has cutting-edge technologies in the fields of command and control systems, electronic optical equipment, and aviation systems. I want to develop advanced weapons systems by utilizing the technology of the 4th Industrial Revolution and contribute to the export of defense systems together. I completed an engineering certification program and gained basic competencies as a software engineer. And the IT knowledge gained through several project experiences while in school and the ability to communicate and collaborate with team members will contribute to Hanwha's growth as a global company. I have worked on projects under the theme of 'The foundation of all systems is a network' and 'Development of safety applications between BLE-based bicycles and pedestrians'. I studied how to increase the beacon transmission success rate according to various communication situations, and wrote a paper on the technique of measuring link quality and controlling the beacon transmission cycle through channel congestion. During the project, I learned a lot of network communication knowledge by consulting with the school network laboratory about the obstruction. I think the network is the one that does not fall into any of the fields of ground power, marine system, or aviation industry. Based on my network knowledge, I would like to participate in the development of the next-generation tactical communication system together. I took the ""System Development through Clear Design Process"" and ""Software Design"" to learn how development proceeds from the initial stage of system development to completion as a developer. I worked on a project to analyze system requirements, analyze validity, and prepare requirements. I learned the systematic process of system design by creating a class diagram for object-oriented modeling, and a sequence diagram to understand the dependence relationship between implementation modules. I learned that system development becomes easier after a clear design process. In addition, the system can be developed in C, C++, and Java languages, and various coding abilities such as computer structure, operating system, and system programming have been developed. The project was carried out under the theme of 'Development of BLE-based Safety Applications between Bicycles and Pedestrians' in the course of Comprehensive Design Project 1. We decided to create a beacon transmitter that sends beacon signals that include information such as the current location and speed of the bicycle, and an application that calculates the risk and informs the user. Our team thought that the completion of the project would be enhanced by the ability to transmit the current status information of the bicycle in a beacon and adjust the beacon transmission cycle according to various situations. To control the transmission cycle, we developed the board of the Nordic Semiconductor Company. We decided to adjust the transmission cycle to minimize beacon collisions when multiple bicycles transmit beacon devices at the same time. However, the Nordic board had few users, making it difficult to find the information we wanted on the Internet. We thought about implementing only the current status information transmission function of the bicycle, but we did not give up and tried to solve the problem. We first read the basic user guidebook provided by Nordic companies. And we revised all the example codes related to BLE to understand the codes. We answered the questions by posting them on the Nordic Developer Forum site. We were able to complete the project by varying the beacon transmission cycle depending on the current speed of the bicycle. I realized that if I challenge without giving up even when I am lacking in information, I can achieve my goal, and I have confidence that I can solve any adversity I face. With this confidence, I will become a Hanwha person who does not give up and works patiently."
"""A company that is changing after reading the trends of the times"" I saw an article that CJ Group is converting all IT systems of major affiliates to the cloud for stable IT system operation. Seeing how CJ Group has been able to provide the highest level of service that customers want in various fields so far, by catching up with and responding to the changing trends of the world, I have learned how CJ Group has been able to provide the best service in various fields. I want to become an engineer who responds sensitively to the changes of the times and responds quickly to the latest IT trends and grows by joining a changing company like this. ""Experience until just before system development"" In the second semester of my second year, I took the ""Software Design"" course and learned how to design a software system using UML. And I proceeded with a project to carry out system design based on what I learned. I had the experience of writing a work plan through system requirements, feasibility analysis, requirements definition, etc. by choosing a topic. In the meantime, the major class taught me the knowledge that a developer should have, but this course clearly taught me the process of development. This experience made me interested in system development and applied for the job of system development/operation. In order to perform the ""SW expertise and communication ability"" system development/operation job, I think SW expertise is essential first. As a computer major, I have acquired software development languages such as c, c++, and Java. And I gained IT knowledge through major classes such as software design and operating system. Next, I think I need communication skills to communicate with various people in charge of various tasks. I applied for a volunteer group for the free semester system for college students and taught classes for middle school students. We conducted a survey of each class to attract students' interests, and accepted the request about the class method and class schedule of the teacher in charge of our volunteer group, and obtained advice from the teacher. Through this volunteer activity, I have developed my ability to communicate in various relationships. After joining the CJ Olive Networks IT business department, I want to be reborn as an IT expert who understands not only IT technology but also CJ Group as a whole. To do this, I first have to become an expert in system development, which is my job. I think the core of system development is analysis power. This is because we need to accurately analyze what kind of system our customers want to develop a system that meets their needs. And I think we need to have the ability to quickly adapt to the new environment. Because I understand that the system development job is put into another department related to CJ's business area as a project unit to perform the work. When a new project is put into it, the development environment, work process, or project member often changes, so we need to make efforts to adapt to the new environment easily and quickly. At this time, it is important to quickly adapt to the new environment, but it is also important to quickly understand the work in an unfamiliar field. This is because I think that the department can accurately develop the system it wants only when it understands the work of the department that has been put in. I think it is impossible to study a new field in a new work environment for each project without the spirit of challenge and passion for work. New challenges can be difficult. However, as you work on various projects, you can meet more experts in various fields and learn business in various fields through communication with them. If I become an expert in system development like this, I think I will naturally be able to understand CJ Group's overall work in various business areas. I will become an IT expert who follows trends by continuously paying attention to new technology trends while learning not only IT technology but also other fields of business."
"When I was in college, I worked on a website creation project with three colleagues and I while receiving support from a club. Halfway through the project, my colleague was late for a meeting or began to pass on his work to other team members. The team members started to struggle as the workload increased, and their progress was slowed down. I called my coworker separately and told him why he did it. My coworker said he did it because other projects weren't far off and I thought I could give him some convenience. By reminding me once again of the team's goal of completing the homepage construction on time, I solidified my roles and responsibilities within the team. Also, after explaining what kind of damage my actions have caused the team and what kind of consequences they will have, I decided to explain my motivations at the team meeting and help someone who could afford to do the work. As a result, I was able to successfully complete my motivations and our team's projects on time. When I was a ""network firefighter"" undergraduate, I was assigned to build a network and communicate with the team project by applying routing protocols. Using Ubuntu and Vyos, we installed several servers and routers, including Mail and DNS, and implemented Static, BGP, and OSPF protocols to build a network. I could have done only the assignments given with my team members and submitted them, but in fact, the network is not always stable, such as DDoS attacks, disconnection, and troubleshooting, so I persuaded other team members to generate and solve obstacles that could occur realistically. In addition, we have established a more secure communication network by applying network security such as IPS, IDS, IPSec, and web firewalls so that no one else can check the contents of communication. After the project was completed, the professor said that it had been implemented well in addition to the instructions, and selected it as an excellent project and presented it in front of others. It was a difficult situation to show an uncooperative attitude, such as ""six team members all A+"" team members not attending the meeting or not performing their assignments. For me, who had little experience as a leader at the time, the role of the leader was burdensome, and there was an opinion that I should exclude the team members. However, I couldn't drop out without trying the same group of friends. First, I kept trying to communicate. I asked other team members for their understanding and recommended and persuaded them to do something simple and easy. At first, a friend who only ignored the contact started to participate with my persistence and consideration from the team members, and at the end, we were able to finish the presentation together. Efforts to achieve the overall performance naturally appeared as individual performance, which was an opportunity to learn true teamwork. While preparing for the thesis competition in the club, I was scolded for the incorrectly written interim presentation report. After writing and testing the code myself, the data was recorded randomly because the team member could not write the code. I said sorry and had a meeting with him. I thought about how to solve the problem as soon as possible. After grasping the problems and remaining deadlines, we all agonized over the wrong data, wrote the code, and modified the data according to the form. We created a rule to write and share the reports we each wrote on the bulletin board every week, but if a problem or question arises, we will share it with our team members immediately. Since there is not much time left until the deadline, everyone remained until late, so we studied more and reviewed the materials we shared on the weekend. The completed report was integrated and organized to receive feedback from the professor. With these efforts, I submitted the final report on time and received the excellence award."
"""Professionality, Communication, Innovation Orientation"" Lack of expertise in IT causes more damage due to lack of ability to cope with accidents. Lack of communication makes it impossible to collaborate with work, and if there is no innovation, it is pushed back. In order to develop expertise and innovation, the club won the Excellence Award at the end of the year by conducting projects and seminars on major knowledge and new technologies such as blockchain, IoT, and artificial intelligence every week. In order to develop communication skills, I have attended weekly reading discussion meetings to discuss books I have read with members. By having discussions with members, I was able to cultivate the ability to accept and acknowledge various opinions and to present them logically without being nervous in front of a large number of people. During the Unix programming class, there was a project to create a small Linux by forming a team. The program's window size was developed by continuously discussing how users could use it comfortably, such as what ratio to see, what color to use, and how to display the icons they wanted to emphasize. In addition, we created an evaluation table and asked 20 acquaintances to test the program to receive opinions on what to improve and what to add. In the final presentation, I scored high in user convenience and design, ranking third out of nine teams. The team leader was able to learn that although the abilities and knowledge of the team members are different, they should support and give trust to bring out the maximum capabilities in the areas they are good at. When I was a researcher, hard cleaning was dedicated to the youngest, and there were also three to four weekly interviews with professors and Saturday attendance rules during vacation. Seniors said that it was to see the hierarchy and integrity of the lab, but on Saturday, they only checked their attendance by phone, so there were complaints from juniors. Therefore, on the day of weekly reporting to seniors, I suggested that the cleaning should be done in pairs, and that the interview with the professor should be reduced to two times a week, but the report should be submitted as an assignment. In order to persuade them, we voluntarily sought work, and continuously submitted additional reports as a result of our efforts with our juniors and coordinated the rules by attending half a day on Saturdays. Since then, seniors have faithfully attended on Saturdays, and by cleaning in pairs, communication between seniors and juniors has increased, thereby increasing the efficiency of work. ""Living a Responsible Life"" It is my values that always carry out my duties responsibly. These values enable quick resolution of problems when they arise. At work, we collaborate on many tasks and promote new ones. When a problem arises while pursuing a job, if the person in charge is not responsible, the problem will be either taken off or the responsibility will be passed on, which will cause more damage. The damage is passed on to the company or customers who want to use its services, and as time goes on to recover, other tasks are not allowed to proceed. Therefore, I think that in order to have a smooth working life, it is most important to perform the job responsibly."
"""IT system that I have no choice but to use."" I dream of talented people who go on without stopping. This is because I think that the moment I am complacent at my level, I will be eliminated. I applied because I thought that KD DS was the best company to achieve this dream. KT DS is currently running a voluntary learning organization called Windmill. It is a system that employees themselves work hard and support to strengthen their capabilities in IT technology and business and lead the market. I thought this system was the best environment to achieve my dream. The goal that I want to achieve after joining the company is to develop an IT system that customers have no choice but to use, not because they want to. What I mean is that I have no choice but to create and use an IT system that maximizes convenience. To this end, I will achieve the following goals. First, after joining the company, I will quickly adapt to KT DS. I will create an environment in which I can maximize my capabilities by forming a bond with my employees. Second, I will strengthen my capabilities through my work and identify customer needs. I will identify functions that I develop frequently and lay the groundwork for the development of customized IT systems. Third, we will develop a customized IT system based on the identified needs. Through this development, we will maximize customer convenience. KT DS will continue to move forward without stopping, and we will develop an IT system that we have no choice but to use rather than because we want to use it while achieving our goals one by one to bring customer satisfaction. I once planned a flea market during the festival to raise funds for overseas volunteer work to ""achieve sold-out."" The goal was to raise funds, so I needed items that could benefit greatly from a small budget. I recommended the material because I thought that the thread bracelet, which is all about the thread, could bring a lot of profit on a small budget, and I set a goal of selling out because I was in charge of it. Contrary to expectations that sales would be good because the price was not high, the sales rate was low. Measures were needed to solve the problem. So, we gathered our team members and decided to make promotional flyers. I tried to attract people's attention by talking about wearing a thread bracelet and the story that a wish comes true while using it. The next day, I went around the school and handed out flyers. As a result, the sales rate increased, but it was difficult to sell out as it is. I thought of a way to promote flyers effectively, and I thought that it would be more effective to do intensive promotions at a place leading to the central library and student cafeteria, which are frequently used by students, rather than going around and promoting them. In the end, all sales were completed on the last day through this method. As a person in charge, I tried harder than others, and I was able to feel a sense of accomplishment due to successful results. Through this experience, I learned that if effort is added to your passion, it will come out as a result. I will contribute to the development of KT DS through passionate efforts at KT DS. ""Completing the App through Collaboration"" I participated in the development of the app in the ""Smart Door Lock Using BLE Beacons"" project in connection with OOO Systems. The project divided the roles into App, Arduino, Server, and DB, and I was in charge of the app. I had to study how to use the beacon first. It was because I had never used it before, so I had difficulty getting beacon information from the app. To this end, I learned how to implement it by analyzing open sources related to beacons. After that, I was able to actually apply the code, continuously modify the code appropriately, and import beacon information. Through this, we were able to implement the door lock unlock function according to the distance from the beacon and complete an app that allows users to easily control the door lock. The app I was in charge of was the most important part of the project, so I spent a lot of time working hard to create a high-quality app. There were some difficulties in the process of thinking about and implementing the function of the app, but I was able to solve them by not giving up and looking for similar open sources and applying them directly through analysis. During the project, I had to undergo continuous inspection by the company and was under pressure to complete it in time, but I was able to have persistence and responsibility in the process. Also, I was able to feel a sense of cooperation by seeing the team members who worked hard to achieve a common goal. Based on this experience, I will do my best in my duties at KT DS, and at the same time, I will try to collaborate with my team members to show successful results. ""Problem-solving, Customer Identification"" I think what is necessary to perform the SW job is the problem-solving ability and the ability to identify customers. It is because problem-solving ability through thinking is basically required for work, and development through customer identification brings customer satisfaction. I strengthened my capabilities through the following efforts. First, I studied algorithms to develop problem-solving ability. After studying basic theory, I developed application ability through online algorithm problem-solving sites. After that, I studied by comparing the differences by looking at other people's codes. In addition, I continued to strive to strengthen my capabilities by completing 40 hours of special lecture on algorithms for college students. Second, I increased my satisfaction by practicing learning through failure. I planned an overseas volunteer calligraphy program. I planned it with the aim of experiencing Korean culture, but I experienced failure because I could not grasp that children prefer activities that move their bodies a lot. Through this, I learned that it is important to identify customers first. Based on this learning, while conducting software education for middle school students, I tried to identify students by giving one-on-one explanations for those who feel difficult in class content. After the explanation, I identified the needs of the students by asking if there was anything else I wanted to know. Through this process, I was able to gradually create the class that the students wanted and improve their satisfaction.Based on what we have learned from our experience, KT DS will solve the problem based on customer identification to bring customer satisfaction."
"""Harmony of Security and Simplicity"" IT technology is at the center of the rapidly changing world right now. It is not an exaggeration to say that the future direction depends on the hands of those dealing with these IT technologies, and its importance is growing. Samsung SDS, which provides strong security and simple services based on IT technology, is also a company that I will be with in the future. To follow this step, I conducted a 'Book Recommendation Project Using Data Analysis' as my graduation work to consider the importance of data and ways to improve the simplicity of real life. The important point of the project was to strengthen security and make it easier to use the desired books in order to store the data of the users who use the service. To build this, the ARIA encryption algorithm, which can be used in various environments, was used to enhance security, and the desired book type was recommended by analyzing the user's data. As a result, I received the evaluation that it was a service that solved the user's concerns and achieved the silver award at the graduation work academic festival. I believe that as technology advances, the importance of protecting personal information and improving user convenience will increase. Based on my previous experience, I would like to become a member of Samsung SDS and build a solution that catches two rabbits, security and convenience like Wearable EMM and Nexsign. ""Goals Set and Action"" I made an effort to set goals clearly and to acquire the ability to implement them. In college, I majored in computer engineering and built up various IT knowledge, and set my goal of ""developing innovative services in line with the rapidly developing IT era."" Based on this goal setting, the following projects were implemented to improve service development capabilities. First, I participated in the 2018 Fall Korean OOOO Association College Student Competition. I had a goal that I wanted to challenge myself in a new field, and based on the embedded programming class I took in the first semester of the 4th year, I developed 'Indoor Location and Path Estimation App Service' based on Beacon, a mobile service based on Beacon IOT. Since it was my first attempt at this field, it was difficult to design and implement. In particular, an error of about 10m occurred in the part of estimating the user's location using the beacon's RSSI signal strength. In order to solve this problem, the evidence was established through books, papers, and the Internet, and we found that the error can be reduced to about 2m if pedestrian speculative navigation (PDR) is used as a gyro (direction) sensor inherent in smartphones. As a result, I was able to develop my ability to establish a basis for the problems I faced in order to achieve my new goal based on objective and reliable data. Second, from May to June in the first semester of the 4th grade, we participated in an idea contest using public data of the marine and fishery with the aim of providing convenient services to someone by utilizing the IT knowledge we learned at university. There was a difficulty in converging numerous data because it was the creation of ideas using public data. In order to solve this problem, a survey on 'convenience and requirements' was conducted on about 20 department professors and students living near the coast, and three important data were derived. Finally, the illegal fishing boat notification app service was planned by converging the fishbowl information, ship operation information, and TAC operation information data obtained from the survey and the contents on the eradication of illegal fishing boats, which were controversial at the time. A software engineer is a person who presents and applies solutions by quantifying and subdividing specific problems. In other words, I thought that goal setting and implementation should be the basis for challenging new fields and thinking to provide convenient services to users, so I tried to put them into practice. In the modern society, personal information leakage accidents are becoming an issue as processing of personal information rapidly increases due to the development of ICT and the spread of the Internet. According to the Korea Internet & Security Agency, personal information leakage accidents more than doubled in 2018 compared to 2017. The leakage of personal information is having a great influence on corporate economic factors and images. In particular, the leakage of personal information through ransomware is causing additional damage. Ransomware is evolving into a customized attack that reflects the specificity of society and culture, such as year-end settlement and internal guidelines, making it more difficult to respond. In recent years, it is expanding in all directions to individuals, companies, and countries. In addition, it is believed that it will penetrate our daily lives, from attacks on the financial and medical sectors that have sensitive data to recent threats to national infrastructure and IoT. I think the following efforts are needed to prevent such ransomware. First, it is the e-mail attachment detection function. It is judged that the detection function is necessary not only for the .exe extension detection used by existing hackers, but also for various document files such as .word.hwp. Second, it is a frequent update. Since we attack through security vulnerabilities, I think we need to supplement the vulnerabilities with frequent software updates. Based on these two efforts, we will be able to provide improved protection against the developing attacks of hackers, and it will also have a positive impact on business competitiveness and economic benefits."
"I think the important thing in the 4th Industrial Revolution is to create new values based on data. I thought Lotte would provide differentiated services unique to customers in a rapidly changing society based on the experiences and know-how gained in various industries. I applied because I want to grow into a SW expert at Lotte, which is expected to grow further. I studied and practiced databases, big data, and AI, which I felt were insufficient while completing my major course, through the ""Deep Learning and Machine Learning-based Data Analyzer Training Course."" Since then, I have developed my expertise by conducting web and app projects. I have also gained practical experience through two internships. Based on these capabilities, I want to grow into an expert who leads new technologies at Lotte. ""Developer of Philosophy"" I feel a great sense of accomplishment in enjoying the process of constantly thinking and gaining results or enlightenment through it. So, my favorite subject in high school was philosophy. The great attraction was that philosophy books do not make sense at once and that there can be various approaches. It was a liberal arts department, and there was a class that greatly influenced me when I was a senior in high school. In my third year of high school, my math teacher told me that I must go to college and take a programming class with an explanation of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. I couldn't understand it at the time, but I realized the meaning after encountering various news and articles. I thought that understanding IT, which has a huge impact on the entire industry, was essential in a new era. Furthermore, I decided that I could lead a new era if I had IT-related expertise. Afterwards, I boldly applied for cross-subsidized and entered OOO Information and Communication University. After entering the school, I focused on my poor math and programming classes. While taking the programming class, I found that it fits well with my aptitude. I thought that the process of thinking about how to make a more efficient program and finding the cause of the error was similar to the process of philosophy. I enjoyed the process of finding the cause of the error by debugging in assignments and practice, and I felt great pleasure when the program was successfully driven. From this time on, I dreamed of becoming a developer and improved my expertise through major classes and state-funded programs. ""Achieving 30 Orders A Day"" For two months, I have experienced an internship at OOOO located in OO. OOOO is a distributor that imports Korean fashion, beauty, and miscellaneous goods products and sells them in shopping malls and open markets in Japan. My task was to register, deliver, and handle customer response to Amazon Japan seller's account, which had been neglected. First of all, I reviewed the product sales page from the customer's point of view to find out why the order was not coming in. I found a problem that the introduction of the previously sold product was short and the letters were small, making it difficult to see. In order to solve this problem, I created a product introduction image to increase the readability of the product sales page. After that, I practiced explaining the product description being sold in Japanese. Although I am not selling it in person, I thought that selling without understanding the product could be a problem in customer response in the future. At first, I made a mistake in entering the address and managing the order. I responded to customer inquiries about the delay in delivery, asking for advice from the employees. However, the number of orders, which was about 5 at the time I joined the company, reached 30 a day in two months. I became busier as the number of orders increased, but I worked passionately. The most pleasing thing was the five stars and reviews left by customers after purchasing the product. One line of reviews saying that the product is good and delivery is fast came as a huge achievement to me. I proceeded with a web production project in the ""Detailed Personality"" web system design class. Five people formed a team and created 'Connect PnP', a site for opening a meeting. Since the project was a month long, it was important to manage the schedule and minimize problems. By showing my meticulous personality, which is my strength, I promised to subdivide the work to be done on a weekly basis by creating a schedule and check the progress every week. We coordinated each other's schedules and had time to meet every Tuesday evening to share each other's progress and discuss problems. My weakness was that when I was focused, I could not care about the surroundings and moved forward by myself. However, through weekly meetings, I was able to learn how to cooperate with the progress of the group members. In the process of division of roles, I was in charge of designing the main page, membership page, administrator page, membership/login function using Kakao API, and pop-up review function. Since it was a site where users opened and participated in meetings, functions related to membership could be implemented only when the membership function was implemented, so the quick development of the membership part was required to meet the set deadline. I had previous experience using Kakao API, so I volunteered and successfully implemented it using the session. As I implemented the UI, I was recognized for my skills among the team members, so I took charge of the final UI inspection. There was no problem with the web function, but I didn't have time, so I fixed the design that was implemented differently from the one I targeted. I checked and fixed the UI with a meticulous nature that didn't miss even a small part to improve the completeness of the project. ""Developer Leading Change"" My goal in 10 years is to become a SW expert who can pioneer and plan new business myself. 5G network, big data, and AI technologies are currently reversing the processes of many industries. In the future, new changes related to new technologies will be created accordingly. Based on my understanding of customers, I will provide a differentiated system using new technologies. We will also detect industrial changes caused by new technologies and create new businesses there. Furthermore, we will lead the change of new technologies based on the SW expertise acquired by Lotte after joining the company.To this end, after joining the company, I will be interested in the customer's industry and processes and always think about what kind of innovation I can bring about with IT technology. In addition, I will always be interested in IT trends and continue my self-improvement as a developer."
"This happened when I was working as an intern. After recruiting students to study abroad, my boss one day told me, ""I have to check the number of students who will be on the bus on the weekend, and there are no workers. It's not mandatory, but I need your help."" On my part, there was a problem with the weekend time being shortened, and I had to leave early before 8 a.m. However, since it was an important school-related event and other employees were away from work, I was willing to respond because if I didn't go, it could cause a setback. Later, I came out early, checked the student list given by my boss, checked that everyone was there, sent them to the bus, and contacted my boss to report that all were on the bus without any problems. It was after I was selected by the school as an overseas tour group in my college days. The main goal was to present my general impressions of the country I traveled to in ppt, photos, and videos, but my team was in charge of filming the videos. I knew how to film the videos, but I wanted to know how to leave a more impression on the judges, so I asked the team members. Fortunately, since the team leader studied filming in college, I listened to various advice and studied shooting practice and simple editing methods. I also partially participated in ppt production, taking advantage of my previous experience in design without receiving help. Thanks to this, the work went smoothly, and as a result of organizing it in between during the trip, I was able to complete the report within 3 to 4 days, which took about a week shorter than expected, and I received the grand prize in the final evaluation as I was evaluated as flawless in ppt, video, or perfect. As I was working on this project, I realized that what I felt more than awards or travel was the cooperation between team members. In my fourth year of college, I created a game as a graduation project. With the goal of creating a stage with a beginning and an end, we decided to use all kinds of knowledge to proceed together within 3 months. However, a problem occurred during production, and one of the group members was employed and did not have many opportunities to participate, and I was confused about how to use the knowledge I had learned to create the game. As a team leader at the time, I thought that the top priority was to unite the team members, and we gathered all of the team members and had a meeting to resolve this conflict. We also found and coordinated time zones where all of the team members could participate through the meeting, studied game production while finding ways to create a game, met and developed the game for the remaining three days, and if there was anything we didn't know, we put our heads together to solve it. Thus, we were able to submit our results in time for three months and achieve our goal [to create a stage]. Through this experience, I realized that I needed to come up with better results by solving problems through communication and collaboration with others."
"As part of my employment activities, I made ceaseless efforts to enhance my computer knowledge by studying for my major and obtaining a certificate. What I realized while taking major-related courses in university was as follows. * While learning logical circuits, I came to know the concepts of logical computation and digital circuits. * While learning the data structure, I realized how to express data structurally. * While learning algorithms, I was able to devise procedures for problem solving and various approaches. This later affected my acquisition of certification. * While learning the operating system, I was able to grasp the detailed concepts about computer OS that we commonly use. * Through the computer structure, I understood the functions and interactions of the components that make up a computer. In this way, I was able to obtain comprehensive credits for these subjects and obtain an information processing engineer in order to realize more than the knowledge I learned in school. Thanks to this, I was able to reach my goal quickly and accurately by applying these knowledge to minimize problems while working on the graduation project. I am sure that my experience will be helpful to KEPCO KDN. The main task of KEPCO KDN (hereinafter referred to as kdn) is to 'manufacture and manage overall computer systems of KEPCO and its affiliates'. For the efficient power control and management of KEPCO, a parent company, the role of kdn in charge of websites and related software is important. Reflecting this role of kdn, I think I can contribute to the computer management of kdn, which is the reason why I think that the overall understanding of the computer system is faster than other non-acquirers, and I think it is suitable for managing this power management without errors due to my professional nature, which handles everything carefully, and carefully. In addition, I have a design sense as I ran a blog on the subject of my work in college, and I can contribute to the visual convenience that is important for managing web pages and the intuition of interfaces. No matter how much I have the ability to create a complete website with only web programming languages and text coding tools, lack of design aesthetic sense and visual placement skills will make users uncomfortable when searching the website. I was working on my graduation project. There were originally a total of three members in my team, including two members of the team, but the problem was that one of the team members was employed. Instead of appearing on the midterm presentation or important interviews with professors, he did not want to take on important roles such as programming or design, and instead passed on to me as the team leader. One of the other team members was also negligent, trying to pass on all the tasks to me on the pretext that he had learned nothing. So I ran into two difficulties, wondering whether to persuade them to share the roles and go with them to the end or to withdraw the team members. It was uncertain whether the team members who had no will would be able to accomplish the task properly if they continued, and on the contrary, if they withdrew the team members, they might be deducted from the group cooperative score. So I consulted the professor about this, called the team members, talked about it, and then withdrew the students who had already been employed, and asked the remaining one to find what he could do and participate in the project. Fortunately, that judgment helped to flow smoothly and I was able to accomplish it safely. In addition to obtaining a certificate and studying hard in the department, I wanted to create a web page using my design sense after graduation. However, I had never received any training on web programming, but just in the meantime, I heard that there was a state-funded education for Java web programming through my school, and I received training for about five months to develop my skills. The main curriculum was to create a basic web page framework using Java language, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript, and to connect a database here to create a basic guest book website. While taking intensive classes in the classroom for seven hours a day, I repeatedly learned the parts that I did not remember after class and personally created a web page for practice, enhancing my understanding by making it my own. And after the whole curriculum was over, I was able to learn about the composition and production process of web pages by creating a visitor's book website as a practice, and as a result, I was able to create basic web pages. I think this ability can contribute in terms of the creation and management of the web page within the kDN. Ethical consciousness at work is an important factor in ensuring that there is no damage in the corporate and social aspects. This sense of ethics is particularly prominent in public institutions that are closely related to the state. In my opinion, the members of the ethical consciousness are the employees within the institution, and these are the faces of the state. This is because every aspect of their facial expressions, tone, actions, etc. are shown to customers every day. Whenever we encounter them, we see them, judge the image of the government and the country indirectly, and I believe we trust the government accordingly. In other words, I think that their office work ability, service to customers, and even between individual employees are clearly linked to public trust. This lack of ethical consciousness follows just from the occasional irregularities within state agencies that have appeared in the news. People are concerned that such news will reduce their trust in the state and further distrust the state and the government. Therefore, before these things happen, employees of public institutions should act carefully anytime, anywhere, with the mindset that they truly serve as examples for the people. Above all, an attitude to clarify public affairs is the top priority for employees of public institutions."
"I applied because I wanted to help new students set goals that they could do. When I join the company, I will work in the attitude of learning from scratch no matter where the department I am assigned to in the early stages. Above all, I will listen to the advice of a senior who has more work experience than me first, and if I don't know, I will not be shy about asking. Furthermore, I will organize things I don't know in a notebook, and as the field I applied is computerized, I won't forget to study related things separately after work. It is cooperation and communication. When I was working on a graduation project at school, there was a block in the middle. Most of the team members lacked knowledge, so it was not enough to do it alone, but when they put their heads together, it went easier than before. Once, I did not have enough documents while performing my duties, and I was able to tell the team member about this, and then contact another team who was scheduled to be on a business trip in the same area. If I hadn't told the team member this first at this time, I would have had a big problem, if not, getting in trouble with my work. I obtained an article to improve my major. Among the subjects I learned in my third year of college, there were <Logic Circuit> and <Operating System>, and these subjects helped me a lot in obtaining certification. In addition to college class, there was a time when I made my own bulletin board while taking a web programming class at an academy after graduation, and I thought that the more I learned, the better my skills will be, so I came home to review what I learned that day. And I registered on an online coding site to solve algorithm problems and not forget my sense of major field. I worked on a project when I was in my fourth year of college. If it was a problem, one of the team members got a job and didn't have many opportunities to participate, and I was confused about how to use the knowledge I had learned so far in production. As the team leader at the time, I first gathered my team members and had a meeting. Through the meeting, we arranged the time when all the team members could participate, and the project proceeded by studying two days a week, meeting three days a week, and meeting with them three days to solve problems by asking each other if there was anything they didn't know. As a result, we were able to complete the results according to the target period of 3 months, and I realized that better results could be produced by solving problems through cooperation with others. Ethics is an important factor in ensuring that there is no damage in the corporate/social aspects of work. What constitutes this ethics is the employees in the school, and I think these are the faces of the school. This is because their facial expressions, tone, behavior, etc. are shown to students. Therefore, I think first of all, employees should be more honest with others. In my previous job, the deputy director often mentioned it, and if you hide something without being honest, it will not only cause a big problem in proceeding with the work, but it can also undermine the trust of the school, not only the person who lied."
"""Passion for Financial IT"" While working as a part-timer at a bank as a security guard, the bank responded to various clients' requests. Among them, the most common request was how to use IT services, such as Internet banking. This is because the complicated process of using Internet banking was a huge barrier for customers who were not familiar with using IT devices. Through this experience, I became interested in financial IT, hoping that I could provide financial IT to users more conveniently. Tiscis has secured high competitiveness in the comprehensive financial market by successfully performing ITO for various financial companies as well as projects within the Heungkuk Financial Family. In this regard, Tiscis applied because it thought that it was the best stage to do financial IT that I wanted. ""Passion for Learning"" I think a developer is a lifelong learning job. This is because I have to adapt to the IT environment that develops day by day. And I have a passion for learning. I have tried to become a developer who constantly learns through mentoring financial IT experts and the Java Front-End developer process. ""Various Development Experience"" Based on various development experiences, we have laid the foundation for the successful performance of IT service development and maintenance duties at Tsis. Through the Hanyum ICT mentoring project conducted with financial IT practitioners, we have gained skills in developing the web through database, Android app development, and JSP as well as project management through youth case definition, ER diagram, requirement tracking chart, etc. As a result, we became interested in web development and gained knowledge of the overall web development through the Java Front-End developer course organized by OOO. We have also developed a customized card recommendation website based on user consumption patterns and developed our development capabilities by using the Vue.js framework. We have experience in achieving A+ results by improving projects that received C+ credits. ""The result of planning failure"" Our team decided to create a mobile 2D jump game app using C# language and Unity. After working hard on the development with our team members, we were able to complete the alpha version of the game a week before the presentation. However, we realized that the more we conducted the test, the less fun the game became. The failure to predict this during the planning stage was the root cause. To make up for this, we added fun elements by adding obstacles and stages, but it was not enough to correct the wrong plan in a short period of time. In the end, our team was poorly evaluated by professors and classmates in the project presentation and received a C+ grade. I couldn't easily accept the C+ grade because all of the ""Methodology"" team members were enthusiastic about developing the game. So, our team decided to improve the problems of the previous project and try again in the graduation project. The waterfall development methodology that was adopted earlier was not suitable for game development that often changes because it is developed based on a fixed plan. Therefore, our team sought a development methodology that could respond quickly to changes, and as a result, we decided to adopt a scrum model that repeats a short development cycle. After adopting the ""C+ game from C+ game to A+ game"" scrum model, we proceeded to develop by checking the results through planning-development-test steps in a short period of time. Through that process, we tried to make a fun game. As a result, I was able to complete the game successfully and even registered an app on the Play Store. In addition, it was well received by professors and classmates, so I was awarded an encouragement award at the project presentation and an A+ grade in the subject. Through this, I realized that not only implementing the project but also introducing appropriate development methodology is very important to the success of the project. ""The most important practical competency - Communication"" I think the most important competency for developers is communication skills. This is because development projects are carried out in cooperation with people in various roles. I think there are two main communication competencies of developers. First, communication through code. I think communication with fellow developers is achieved through code. For smooth communication, I think it is important to write highly readable codes and to accurately comply with work standards within the organization. Second, communication through words. I think developers should be able to accurately grasp the other person's needs and clearly explain what they are trying to say. I also think it is very important to listen to and respect the other person's opinions and strengthen teamwork. ""My Communication Competency Level - 80 Points"" I tried to develop the aforementioned communication competency through various team project experiences. In order to increase the readability of the code, we made efforts to create appropriate method names and variable names so that even other team members could see what function the code was performing at a glance. In addition, we actively used version management systems such as Git and Github to communicate efficiently with team members. ""Problem identification ability and strong will to improve"" My strengths are problem identification ability and strong will to improve. When I was taking the Java Front-End developer course, I had worked on a team project for 1 night and 2 days. Our team decided to develop a website that introduces and reviews famous restaurants and worked on it. Since the project had to be completed during the short development period, the team members distributed their roles and focused on development. And we proceeded with the development by sending the results we developed individually to one person and collecting them. However, before the deadline, we had to face numerous errors in the process of collecting our results. In the end, we had to spend a lot of time debugging and submit unsatisfactory results. Our team's problems were.They were unable to manage the database in their local environment, and because they did not deploy a version management system, they manually combined the codes of each team member. And in the project over the following month, we built a database on the AWS cloud server, so that all of our team members could use the same database to efficiently develop it, and we systematically performed version management using Git and Github. I am confident that my strengths in identifying and actively improving problems will greatly help me quickly diagnose and resolve problems that may arise from Tsis. ""Health management"" My weakness is that I have been negligent in health management. I spent 12 hours a day working on development at the academy while working on the Java Front End developer for three months. As a result, I was negligent in health management, and as a result, I caught the flu and couldn't take the lecture for two days. Through this experience, I became acutely aware that health management is also one of the important items in performing the development job. Since then, I have been paying attention to health management through high-quality nutrition and exercise in my spare time. ""Work knowledge and development, two rabbits."" In five years, I want to become a financial IT expert who is good at both work knowledge and development. In order to become a financial IT expert, I think you need to be able to accurately grasp not only the development capabilities but also the work of the client company. This is because it is possible to accurately understand the requirements of the client and reflect them in the development. To this end, I will acquire work knowledge through active communication and constant learning with the field. In addition, I will continue to learn to improve my development capabilities such as development language, design pattern, and software engineering. ""Project manager"" In 10 years, I want to become a project manager and lead a project to success. The experience of various projects and two PMs gave me the opportunity to feel the importance and attractiveness of project management. I realized that project managers are the most important roles in projects that are involved in all parts of the project, such as schedule management, code management, and development document management, as well as relationships with team members. In order to successfully perform the role of project manager, various development experiences are essential. If I perform my development job at Tiscis, I will try to become a project manager who can produce high-quality software output by enhancing my perspective on the overall development through various development experiences and making my seniors' know-how."
"As technology advances, the gap between urban and rural areas is widening, and I think it is better to balance rural areas by converging rather than balancing them along the cities. With the introduction of ICT technology in rural areas, smart farms are being promoted. Internet connection to plantations and greenhouses is required for this. If high-speed Internet is the basis for this, it will be possible for rural areas to receive educational services regardless of physical space. Effective education is possible through realistic educational services using VR and AR along with the establishment of large-capacity ultra-low-latency networks if 5G networks are introduced, and both programs and learning materials can be delivered to the same level of educational environment through the cloud, regardless of location or terminal. E-commerce will also be strengthened by improving health services and distribution services through public infrastructure or remote medical treatment by applying ICT solutions such as crop theft prevention systems and disaster alarm. In this way, we believe that if the education and health sectors are promoted while taking into account the elderly population of rural areas and the infrastructure is designed in a way that prioritizes inflow over population outflow, the walls between urban and rural areas can be broken down and harmonized. Diversity and acquisition power are my competitiveness. Current technologies are not developing into the field itself, but through convergence with other fields. Seeing this trend, I challenged myself in various fields. While working in a factory, I operated and inspected equipment such as CNC machines and milling machines, and challenged 3D design and design for characters and models, and worked as an instructor in operating equipment, repairing, inspecting, and checking them. What I felt while working in various activities were all related, and my perspective on the system expanded. I learned this point once again while working as an industry-academia project under the theme of smart farm facilities. It is not just about building a database and controlling sensors, but based on this, I realized that how to design the hardware, what are the optimal conditions, and knowledge other than my major is required. When performing a job, I am confident that we will do a job that will be smooth. Smooth communication is possible when cooperating with external companies or other departments, and the system can be planned with a wider perspective. In order to balance urban and rural areas, I think it is a priority to find a way to prevent the outflow of population in rural areas. I thought about what is the biggest factor in the outflow to rural areas. As a result, the biggest reason is the preference for cities with excellent educational infrastructure. What I plan is to make the educational environment the same as the city rather than giving additional points to the excellent selection of rural areas. The biggest goal is to introduce the 5G network in earnest and provide realistic education services using VR and AR that are beyond physical limitations. In addition, programs and learning materials can be provided in the same level of educational environment for both urban and rural areas regardless of location and terminal use. I think it is important to break down the physical wall like this. In addition, in the case of universities, there is already a foundation for an e-learning system, so the system construction period can be shortened in connection with it. If the public's perception improves due to the generalization of realistic education services, the wall on the educational environment between urban and rural areas will be broken down."
"""Motivation for application"" I am not satisfied with the present and always challenge various fields. I am preparing for future technological changes by challenging various fields such as programming, data and AI, and quality control, not just in my major. TmaxSoft has maintained the No. 1 title of JEUS, a web application server, but has not stopped developing technologies by introducing competitive solutions such as TIBERO Data, a DB management solution, and ProFrame, an application framework, to the market. TmaxSoft's constant efforts while leading the middleware market always captured my heart, and I applied with a nervous mind. I applied for a job at TmaxSoft consulting, where I can best demonstrate my experience in analyzing competitors, taking charge of SW knowledge and marketing projects including DB, AI, and development that I have. As an engineering student, I want to provide principles and information of products that are easy to understand through direct communication with customers. And I will become a new employee in the consulting job who will serve as a bridge to analyze VOCs and deliver them to R&D and technical support departments to improve products. ""Aspiring after joining the company"" Going beyond simply selling solutions to customers, I will act as a bridge between technology support engineers and customers who install solutions to customers. Through this bridge role, I will deliver the conditions and plans that customers want to the technical support engineers to increase customer satisfaction and make TmaxSoft's solution the best in 10 years. And with the AI technology that I have, I would like to understand the demands and requirements of customers and collaborate with the R&D department on artificial intelligence solutions. When TmaxSoft developed AI, deep learning, and machine learning solutions, we will explain them at the customer's level based on the artificial intelligence knowledge and provide the best solution with appropriate price competitiveness according to the customer's environment. And I will not end with selling solutions, but I will become a consultant who helps develop better products by grasping the customer's voice through constant communication even when the customer company uses TmaxSoft's solutions. I majored in material engineering in ""Challenging Personality - Constant Self-Development"", but I have been challenging the field of IT anew. First of all, we started with web programming, processed and visualized tremendous data, and now we are learning a new technology, AI, in the face of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Among the deep learning models, I have experience in building a model that automatically blurs personal information such as faces and license plates, which can be an issue in SNS, single media, and others by using the Faster R-CNN model. While taking KT AI Academy, I worked on a project based on what I learned, such as deep learning and machine learning. I came up with the idea that personal information is a problem because the faces of ordinary people who are not related to content and license plates of vehicles come out on blogs, SNS, and one-person media broadcasts. Previously, Kakao launched a map and blurred using the Faster R-CNN model in Roadview, but there was no public information such as code and data, so I selected a topic that anyone, including single media operators and SNS users, could use. For three weeks, four team members analyzed the base paper related to the Faster R-CNN model and built the model with tensorflow using Github's open source. The Python code was changed for blur processing, and the two modules, object detection and blur, were merged into a shell script in two steps so that they could use both the Faster R-CNN model and blur. For training, we performed 110,000 iteration of 5 epochs using the WIDERFACE dataset, and for license plates, we performed training with 5 epochs with 1,200 pieces of data taken by ourselves. We tried the training for the first time and detected the license plate. However, there was a problem of recognizing only the faint license plate, not the clear license plate. And in principle, there should be one bounding box per person for facial data, but there was a problem of catching multiple bounding boxes. In order to solve the problem, we asked researchers from KT Convergence Technology Institute to increase the iteration of training and increase the number of clear vehicle license plates and large face datasets. My role in the team was to analyze the paper and use Faster R-CNN, pyblur code analysis, and movingPY to blur in the existing video to produce the result. At first, I tried to make it into an app, but it was not implemented due to lack of time and technology. As an alternative, after cutting the video frame by frame and processing the blur processing, the pictures were combined through movingPY to create the result as a video. By applying this model to street broadcasting, we applied blur processing on the faces of ordinary people who had nothing to do with the content, and achieved an accuracy of exceeding mAP 0.5. Due to the high accuracy, the demo video came out well, so we were able to achieve good results on the KT Convergence Technology Institute road show, and whether or not to commercialize it is in progress because patents are currently in progress. Using the ""Development Project - Rich IT Experience"" JSP and Maria DB, I have experience in building a hamburger delivery system based on the logistics information system. In the web page implementation project for about two weeks, I implemented the web design with CSS. Among them, my role was the role of the developer in charge of the bulletin board and the DB manager. Using eXERD, a total of 9 DBs required for delivery services from raw material inventory were modeled and built as maria DB. Although I was a DB manager who thought it would end with the design and construction of the DB, I often reflected the opinions of my team members and revised it during the project for a total of two weeks. After about 30 DB modifications, I learned the DB construction process in the project.Along with the DB manager, I have been making efforts to create a perfect bulletin board by organizing bulletin boards with JSP files. Based on what I learned in class, I went through numerous trials and errors to attach files and to put them on the list, but after tenacious challenge, I was able to taste success. ""Achieving Mentee's Dream"" In mentoring for out-of-school youth, I introduced a agonizing and career counseling program to boost student motivation, and I had the experience of achieving student goals in the same year. I taught English and math as mentors to out-of-school youth preparing for the GED with the goal of passing the GED. Other mentors also taught class with the goal of passing the GED, so I also focused at first on teaching the subject. However, Mentee was bored with repetitive classes and needed stimulation to motivate them anew. In order to understand what they want to be in the future, their daily worries, and the goal of taking the GED, we made a 15-minute daily counseling session every day, including the class. Through guidelines and homework, they created an opportunity for mentee to agonize every week. In this process, it led Mentee to dream of becoming an aircraft mechanic. Especially since I was a graduate of the aviation college, I was able to give vivid information such as what subjects the aviation students were learning and how they prepared. Mentee set a specific goal of entering the Department of Aviation Maintenance at Inha University or entering the Department of Language and Literature at a four-year university by utilizing Mentee's English ability as a result of counseling her concerns in the curriculum where she had only taught previously. Other mentors were also interested in this change, so I provided the same format of guidelines and forms I used to other mentors as well. Although pure class time was reduced, Mentee, who set the goal right, had been meticulously doing a larger amount of homework than before, so the class progress was able to go further. Mentee found her dream and received high scores on the high school entrance and high school graduation exam, and the following year, she became a college freshman majoring in English literature and was able to achieve her goal. ""The Best Outcome of Communication"" Two science and engineering students and two humanities students gathered to receive the grand prize for the ""Photo App Life Marketing Strategy."" Team members who had no expertise worked together to carry out projects and challenged new fields through communication beyond each major to achieve the best grades. As an engineering student, I participated in a small and medium-sized business experience camp to challenge a new field of marketing. However, the friends who were assigned to the same team were distant from marketing to the extent that this desire was overshadowed. Two humanities students and one science and engineering student like me had to come up with an application promotion strategy. From the first meeting, I only came up with vague ideas and couldn't even get an outline. The problem was not the lack of expertise, but the lack of confidence. As a team leader, I wanted to give him confidence, so through interviews with my team members, I talked about the areas that the team members could do well and suggested doing what they could best. Contrary to the atmosphere before when I was not confident, I was able to freely talk about their specialties, and through the process, I was able to boost my confidence. Thanks to this, science and engineering students are good at analyzing data, so we analyzed the success factors of our competitors, Daygram and Analog Tokyo, and the students of the Department of Public Administration focused on measuring the expected effectiveness of marketing and making presentation table of contents data. It was a marketing strategy task that seemed to have been unable to do, but it was outlined in the direction of ""promoting through SNS by paying activity fees to university students in Daegu,"" and based on this, we were able to increase the reality through a balanced perspective between science and engineering and liberal arts. What I thought was a weakness became a strength, and since we analyzed and benchmarked our competitors well, we were able to receive the grand prize from teams from all over the country.."
"I have often used the Altools series from Eastsoft Corporation. I had a familiar image about it, and I decided that although I was a contract worker, it could be an experience for me to join Eastsoft in the future. I have a lot of part-time job experience such as factories, convenience stores, restaurants, and frozen air conditioners. I have experienced various fields, and accordingly, I have also learned skills such as 3D printing, drones, CNC machines, milling machines, etc. In order to proceed with the entrusted work efficiently, I continued to learn related knowledge, showed good results, and formed a smooth relationship, and I still keep in touch with the business owners until now. I had various experiences and realized what is my favorite job and what is my aptitude. As a result, I chose the software field and applied for the data construction assistant to lay the foundation for my career. I have the experience of working hard at three part-time jobs at the same time without any difficulties in being late or working. In order to manage 3D printers that are new to the factory, I have worked hard as an assistant 3D printing instructor and received a business proposal for the 3D printing technology. If the task is assigned, I can tell you from experience that you can work faithfully in a focused attitude without being lazy. As mentioned earlier, learning will continue for better results or shortcomings during the process."
"Distribution was the most impressive field among various fields, such as restaurant, distribution, and finance, which I experienced while working as an IT consulting intern. With the idea of a new business, I planned a ""face-to-face identification solution"" targeting unmanned convenience stores. Currently, alcohol sales at unmanned convenience stores require confirmation from employees face-to-face, and cigarettes have limitations in that they can only buy cigarettes after each time being verified by ID card. With this in mind, I suggested a way to purchase cigarettes with one face authentication by simultaneously authenticating the face and ID card through IT and storing it in the DB. Overcoming the limitations of unmanned goods that the distribution industry has with AI was able to receive a good evaluation. GS ITM has an SCO (unmanned checkout counter) solution and is preparing an unmanned solution for the distribution industry with an automatic ordering system. After completing GS ITM's six-month training, I would like to solve the limitations of the unmanned distribution business's current ""stock clearing by people,"" ""preventing theft of goods,"" and ""face-to-face sales of cigarettes"" through IT. I will become a developer who leads the unmanned distribution business solutions such as managing the inventory of shelves using IoT sensors, preventing theft using intelligent CCTV, and purchasing cigarettes using face and ID recognition. Meanwhile, while preparing for the distribution business project, I found that there are many useful data such as order history data at convenience stores and supermarkets, customer age using intelligent CCTV, gender data, and data on products that sell well according to commercial districts. If this is analyzed as big data, there are many areas where IT can be utilized, such as developing new menus and planning new product promotions at the headquarters level. I will become a talented person who discovers opportunities in these data based on my AI and big data analysis capabilities that I have developed steadily so far. ""Web development - Creating a Hamburger Delivery Web Page"" I have learned JAVA-based web programming technology to specify the career path of IT developers. I have experience in building a hamburger delivery system based on a logistics information system, using JSP and Maria DB. Benchmarking McDelivery, I built the 'OOO Delivery' web page based on the logistics information system. I was in charge of developing the late bulletin board and designing, building, and generalizing the DB table. Using Maria DB, we implemented the function with SQL statements and created a bulletin board that can upload photos in conjunction with the web. Meanwhile, we modeled and built the DB required for the service by using eXERD, a data modeling tool. Although I thought it would end with the design and construction of the DB, many problems were found in the implementation process, and the DB was successfully built through more than 30 revisions. It took a lot of time and effort, but I was able to fully learn the DB construction process and web development. Not only did I develop software for ""AI Development - Personal Information Protection Automatic Blur Project"" but I also challenged AI projects. Among them, the experience that helped the most was the automatic privacy blur project. Using the Faster R-CNN model, we built an AI model that automatically blurs personal information that can be an issue in a single-person broadcast. We learned with 500 photos and performed the task of detecting license plates, but we did not recognize faint license plates, and there was a problem of recognizing one face as multiple faces. In order to solve the problem, I suggested taking pictures of license plates and using various facial Datasets. We learned more than 5 times per photo, and increased the number of clear vehicle license plates and big face datasets. By applying the model to single-person media, we achieved the accuracy of exceeding mAP 0.5 by blurring the face of the general public, and we were able to climb the KT Convergence Technology Institute road show where two out of six teams could participate. I have experience in creating web pages by gathering three non-majors who had no experience in using the spring framework ""to make difficulties enjoyable."" The final project of the six-month SW developer process was to create web pages with the spring framework, analyze big data, and visualize them. It was a project conducted by five people, but two people were absent due to preparation for an interview, and three team members, including me, had to decide whether to proceed with the project as it is or join the team with majors one by one. I thought that it would be more beneficial to study the project together even though it would take a lot of time and effort, so I encouraged my team members and chose the former. Since all three were non-majors, I had to study from the basics, and the concept of the spring framework was difficult compared to Java, JSP, and html/CSS in the previous process. To overcome this, I took a YouTube Spring Framework life coding course and shared progress tables with my team members separately from the class. Through the lecture, I learned the MVC pattern theory and changed the website 'KIC Delivery', which was created by the existing JSP project, to the Spring Framework to learn the practical sense. It started from a different starting point due to the constraints of insufficient number of people and knowledge, but I was able to complete the project called 'FC Barcelona Korean Web Page' within a fixed period of time. It is an experience where I was able to complete the curriculum with the 'Academic Promotion Award' as I appreciate that three non-majors realized a high-level web page without giving up, and I was able to feel the joy of overcoming difficulties. ""New Challenge in the Marketing Field"" Four non-majors unrelated to marketing and application challenged marketing and won first place out of 32 teams. As an engineering student, I wanted to challenge a new field of marketing by working on a team project with people from various majors. Our team's challenge was 'How to promote the LIFE app using SNS' of OOOO, a start-up. However, none of the team members had studied marketing, and I, as the team leader, started distributing tasks to efficiently proceed with the project.We collected opinions from target groups and distributed presentation materials to the team members who majored in political science and public administration with a lot of experience in research. We installed competitor apps directly to each team member who uses Android and iOS to analyze where they gained consumers' sympathy. Finally, we submitted 'OO University Students' One to One SNS Marketing'. We received high marks for effectively benchmarking the strengths by analyzing competitors' marketing plans and submitting a highly feasible plan, and we were able to rank No. 1 among the 32 teams that participated in the camp. 1. Reason for Challenge: Four non-majors who had nothing to do with marketing and apps challenged marketing 2. Reason for Participation: I wanted to know why people are avoiding small and medium-sized enterprises, because I was curious about the current situation of start-ups 3. Difficulties: Because they were all non-majors, I didn't know where to approach and where to start. 4. Efforts to overcome: Finding fundamental information about marketing, I realized that I had to specify targets first. And in order to boost the morale of the team members, I distribute tasks in consideration of the majors of the team members, which were divided into sociology, public administration, chemistry, and material engineering. ex) Social and administration -> Gathering opinions from target groups, producing presentation materials, chemistry, material engineering -> Analyzing the marketing plans of the competitors and role models of the company in charge, installing apps to find out where consumers sympathized. And the role of the person in charge of the company constantly. 5. Result: Finally, a plan was submitted to promote SNS, which paid for activities to university students in the OO area. Non-majors scored high in that they analyzed and benchmarked competitors' marketing plans and submitted realistic plans, and were given the honor of being the first place among the 32 teams that participated in the camp. ""My first living alone with my cousin."" The moment when I settled my boarding life for the past three years and found a room in Seoul and started living alone with my cousin was the happiest moment. I have been living in the dorm for three years in high school and one year in college, and for three years in college, I have been in the dorm. I wanted to make and eat the menu I wanted at the time I wanted, but it was not easy due to the conditions of the boarding house. After graduation, my cousin who lived in Daegu finally found a room and moved in with me after getting a job in Seoul. I moved in and out of the marts with my sister, enjoying cooking. I was able to make and eat various kinds of pasta, such as aglio e olio, vongole, carbonara, pomodoro, and my cooking skills improved day by day. This is the happiest moment in my life when I started living on my own, which I had dreamed of."
"""Jealousy is my strength"" Since childhood, I was an ordinary child who had nothing better or special than anyone else. As a result, I had a high sense of competition with my friends while comparing myself to others. When someone did something, I was greedy to do just that much, so I had to go beyond that friend to be satisfied. My first step was jealousy of a one-year-old Tuul's cousin when I turned 10. When I listened to the sound of a prodigy memorizing Chinese characters at an early age, I started learning Chinese characters because I felt that I could do with jealousy. As I studied for four years after that, I felt a sense of accomplishment through the Chinese character test, and I was able to maintain excellent grades in Chinese literature in middle and high school. During my school years, I was able to achieve unexpected results through competition with my friends. I competed with a friend who memorized world geography, and I started memorizing world maps, and I got a good opportunity by appearing in the Golden Bell. Another time, when a friend with similar writing skills went to an essay writing academy and got a job better, I got to go to the same academy because I didn't want to lose with essay writing. After a while, I won a prize in an essay contest for the first time in my life. I am sure that I am an extremely ordinary person now and in the past. However, I have continued to develop myself with the desire to improve, and as I have done in the past, I will continue to compare myself with the people around me so that their strengths can be mine. When I was taking the ""Sniffing"" management information system course, I carried out a project on the subject of corporate security. I thought I usually lacked leadership, so I volunteered to lead, and I collected the opinions of the team members and divided roles. In the beginning, all the team members faithfully performed their duties, but as time passed, only silence passed. In the end, during the interim inspection, the degree of completion fell compared to other groups, and I couldn't even answer the professor's questions. When the presentation was over and we exchanged opinions on the deficiencies, many said that the information we were looking for was less interesting than we thought. So, in order to lead the participation of the team members, we will apply for an IT fair and a corporate tour and go together. I was able to solve my questions by conducting interviews with working-level officials, and I was able to see and operate security products and new technologies by observing them together at the World IT Show. I was able to complete the project by building a sense of intimacy and increasing participation in a short time. Through this, I was able to fill in the lack of leadership and learn the importance of communication. I will help you successfully finish the project by finding a way to ventilate whenever the project creaks due to the lack of motivation among the team members. I entered this path after watching a documentary on cyber terrorism when I was a student. The incident in which a 9-year-old boy manipulated a TV remote control and caused a train accident shocked me a lot at the time. Since then, I started studying while looking for materials on the security industry. As my first presentation after entering college, I had time to study the history of the virus and cyberwarfare in preparation for cyber terrorism. Recently, ransomware and exchange hacking have increased rapidly, and the importance of information security is increasing. In particular, security is like life because the financial sector is directly connected to the assets of customers. INITECH has solidified its position by developing and providing various security solutions from mobile to DB and IOT, and is striving to develop a blockchain-based authentication system this year. As a member of INITECH, I will study various products and technologies to become a security leader in the upcoming 5G era."
"""Growing Up Through Competition"" Since childhood, I was an ordinary child with nothing special about it. As a result, I had a high sense of competition with my friends around me. I was greedy to do something and do just that much when someone did it. The first step is to compete against a cousin of a one-year-old Tuul, who is 10 years old. When I listened to the sound of a child prodigy while memorizing Chinese letters, I started learning Chinese characters thinking I could do it, so I started learning Chinese characters. After learning for the next four years, I felt a sense of accomplishment through Chinese character verification, and as a result, I got excellent grades in Chinese literature when I was in middle and high school. During my school years, I competed with a friend who memorizes world geography, and started memorizing world maps, and participated in the Golden Bell as a specialty. Once again, when my friend's writing skills improved greatly, I started reading and essay writing and won an essay contest. I have always been an ordinary person. However, I have a strong desire to improve myself. I will continue to digest the strengths of those around me as my own and improve myself. 1. I learned various languages such as C/C++ and JAVA in each grade, and I conducted development projects based on the languages I learned. I decided to develop a trash can management page because I noticed the problem of trash cans that usually overflowed with trash. Working on the project in pairs, I was in charge of DB and server. I received real-time values of lid opening and closing, loading, and fire from the sensor, stored them in the DB, and floated them on the web. However, since I worked with internal IP on campus, there was a fatal problem in that I could not access the finished web. At that time, professors and seniors also recommended receiving a new IP address in the computer room. However, I understood the structure of the network and solved the problem by designating a new DNS. I received an A in the development project subject with the completed work, and I linked it with the classroom trash can, leading to a reduction in collection costs through efficient management. 2. I built a network using routers while taking the system operation Internet security. I configured and redistributed dynamic and static routing tables, and built a firewall using Linux. In the security network, I analyzed packets in real time and performed defense activities such as firewall setting and policy setting. After graduation, I completed an information security training course for 8 months, learning how to operate security equipment and how to check vulnerabilities. Based on what I learned in this course, I challenged and passed the network manager level 2 and became an information processing technician, and now I am studying security law with the aim of becoming an information security technician. I entered this path after watching a documentary on cyber terrorism when I was a test taker. A train accident caused by a 9-year-old boy manipulating a TV remote control shocked me a lot. Since then, I started to study information security by looking at the history of cyber terrorism and viruses. While studying IT security, I realized that it is more important to put corporate assets and information first than to develop convenient services. To this end, I will conduct systematic and continuous information protection activities. I will establish a defense policy by analyzing past hacking cases of financial, telecommunications, and IT companies, and attend security conferences every year to learn new technologies and security information. Based on my accumulated practical experience, I will acquire CISSP and CISA to acquire international-level security technology skills. Thus, I will contribute to obtaining ISMS-P certification for stable system management."
"First, when I took C language, which is the basis for development ability programming, I was in charge of the team leader. It was a good opportunity to develop leadership and achieve A+ by looking at the team members' assignments and studying or teaching them what they did not know. I learned various languages such as C++, JAVA, and Python in each grade, and I proceeded with development projects based on the learned languages. In the project, I was in charge of building a web server, and I installed Debian on Raspabei and uploaded the value stored in the DB to the web server. Second, I built a network using a router while taking Internet security for stable system operation. Dynamic and static routing tables were configured and redistributed, and firewalls were also built using Linux. In the security network, packets were analyzed in real time and defense activities such as firewall setting and policy setting were performed. After graduation, I completed an information security curriculum for 8 months and learned how to check security equipment and vulnerabilities for stable server operation. Based on what I learned in the process, I challenged and passed the network manager level 2 and an information processing technician. Finally, my goal is to obtain an information security technician. Third, I have done web programming studies with my friends to learn html and jsp. I was able to develop my competency by creating a simple web page using CSS, to creating a bulletin board linked to the DB. Through this study, I obtained A in the web page construction course. In addition, I visited IT exhibitions for 3 years, saw new products and technologies in person, and expanded my knowledge by listening to explanations. When I was taking the ""Leadership-Problem Solving Ability"" management information system course, I carried out a project on the subject of corporate security. In order to take the lead in performing the task, I volunteered to lead the team, and collected the opinions of the team members and distributed their roles. In the beginning, all the team members faithfully performed their duties, but as time passed, only silence passed. In the end, during the interim inspection, the completeness was inferior to that of other groups, and I couldn't even answer the professor's questions. After the presentation, when I shared my opinions on the insufficient part, there were many opinions that the information I was looking for was less and interested than I thought. So, I look for various ways to lead the team members to participate. First of all, I will attend the World IT Show with my team members. I was able to encounter security products and new technologies in response to infringement accidents, and learned about future information security tasks. In addition, I apply for an IT company tour to facilitate the progress of the assignment. Although I did not know the infrastructure and technology because corporate security was confidential to the public, I was able to resolve my questions by conducting interviews with practitioners. I was able to complete the project by building rapport and increasing participation in a short period of time. This made me realize the importance of communication and cooperation. I will help you find a way to ventilate whenever the team members' performance creaks due to their lack of motivation when performing construction work. It was when I was volunteering at OO Library. I was assigned to the understaffed children's library on the second floor. Although it is the same size space, the work of Seo Ga-jeong-ri has doubled. Unlike adults, children often hid books to read only for themselves, or left new books on the floor to take out. So I started changing children's behavior to two words: 'Good Child' and 'Bad Child'. He praised me as a good kid when I put a book I read in the book cart or organized a table, and told me that I was a bad kid when I brought out a large amount of books or scattered books, and led me to do the right thing by telling me how to become a good kid. When I was taking the Management Information System course, I carried out a project on the subject of corporate security. In order to take the lead in carrying out the task, I volunteered as the leader, and collected the opinions of the team members and divided their roles. In the beginning, all the team members faithfully performed their duties, but as time passed, only silence passed. In the end, the completeness of the mid-term inspection decreased compared to other groups, and I couldn't even answer the professor's questions. When the presentation was over and we shared opinions on the shortcomings, there were many opinions that the information we were looking for was less and interested than we thought. So, we look for various ways to lead our team members to participate. First of all, we will attend the World IT Show together with our team members. I was able to encounter security products and new technologies that responded to infringement accidents, and I was able to learn about future information security tasks. In addition, I apply for an IT company tour for smooth task progress. Although I did not know the infrastructure and technology because corporate security was confidential to the public, I was able to resolve my questions by conducting interviews with working-level officials. I was able to complete the project in a short period of time by building rapport and increasing participation. This made me realize the importance of communication and cooperation. I will find ways to ventilate the construction work whenever the team members' performance creaks due to their lack of motivation, and I will help them successfully complete the construction work. When I served in the military as a ""blood donation angel,"" I started donating blood with the desire to receive another day of reward leave. However, a small incident changed my mind. When I heard that my grandfather was going to undergo surgery, I donated the blood donation certificate. It was a good opportunity for me to feel that a small act could be of great help to the other person. With this opportunity, everyone's pursuit of happiness based on social contribution has become my ideology"
"I often hear from people around me that I have a strong sense of responsibility for my job. I sometimes lose money in my job due to a strong sense of responsibility, but the reward and achievement I get from completing my job often become the driving force of my life. When I was undergraduate, I participated in volunteer activities to help students learn the subject by mentoring low-income students. Through this OO project, I formed a relationship with two students, and I wanted to be a mentor who was academically and psychologically helpful as the students were in poor circumstances. In order to use the limited time efficiently, I organized a program plan and taught, and I tried to build friendships by leaving the school with the students. For the examinees, the service period was extended from 6 months to 1 year, and as a result, the students received satisfactory SAT grades. When I came home from the mentoring, I was physically challenged after midnight, but I was proud that it was an unforgettable help to the students, and I came to think of the weight of responsibility as the driving force of my action. The first competency required is the ability to handle and analyze data. When I was an undergraduate, I took courses in SAS, R, SQL, and SPSS, and learned the overall process of analysis that extracted the desired data from the DB and used statistical programming to find insights. In addition, prior to the analysis, I realized the ETL process, which accumulates data, the importance of system planning, and construction, and acquired insufficient knowledge by reading database-related books. I acquired statistical certifications about SAS and R, as well as in-depth information about data mining techniques and data structures. The second is organizational and communication skills. I tried a big data contest with my colleagues during my undergraduate years, but I couldn't spend much time because one of my friends passed the internship. It was difficult because of the limited time, but I knew that if each role was fused well, 1+1 could make 10 instead of 3, so I invited the leader to take on each of them. My friend who works in front of the computer is in charge of data cleansing, and I was in charge of PPT, which my friend who is studying for exams is good at writing documents, preparing files, and having a lot of time. As a result, I successfully completed 40 PPTs, and I realized that I could change the organization with an attitude to understand and be considerate of the other person's situation, and that sharing of planned work could increase the efficiency and morale of work. The most important value in my life is '유비무환'입니다'. While working in the Korean traditional music club when I was in middle school, I had the opportunity to perform at a concert with my friends as the representative of the school. I was so worried that I couldn't sleep as it was a big stage. However, my parents taught me that the only solution for achieving and succeeding my goals was thorough practice and preparation, and I practiced so much that I got blisters on my fingers. As a result, I was able to finish the concert without making any mistakes, and I felt a sense of accomplishment and joy through the applause and support I received after finishing the stage. Through this, I realized the need to prepare to achieve a high goal, and I was able to have the habit of preparing more thoroughly than anyone else when challenging new work. With these values, I will complete the internship before joining the company and lay the foundation for becoming a new employee. In order to carry out IT operations, I will learn the structure and principles of software and learn the operational processes to manage the operations of the Dong-A Socio Group throughout the company. I believe that the rapid aging process provides greater growth opportunities for the pharmaceutical and bio industries due to the expansion of the need to engage in healthy physical and social activities without disease. In fact, the domestic pharmaceutical market has established itself as a future food industry, maintaining an annual growth rate of 3% over the past five years despite the global economic downturn. As a member of the Dong-A Socio Group with such high growth potential, I applied to provide innovative IT services for the growth of the group. I believe that a company's IT system performance can determine the existence of a company from a small difference in performance and a large difference in performance. By providing services and insights suitable for various affiliates, the group will contribute to securing business competitiveness, thereby contributing to the growth of the Dong-A Socio Group into a global pharmaceutical company beyond Korea."
"""GS SHOP Who Knows Me Better Than My Family."" A father became angry at a store that offered coupons for baby products such as formula and diapers to his underage daughter, and asked, ""Do you want my daughter to become pregnant?"" and the mart apologized, saying, ""I am sorry."" However, it turned out that she was really pregnant and my father couldn't hide his surprise. This is an example I read in a book about big data. Big data has the power to accurately grasp the needs of customers that even their close family members do not know about. I want to analyze such data so that I can easily expose the products that customers want and make purchases. I applied because I was confident that GS SHOP, which does not spare no investment in big data for mobile-only malls and introduces customized products to enhance customer convenience. ""For data analysts,"" studying various coding and constant self-improvement are essential to handle big data effectively. When I was an undergraduate, I learned various statistical packages such as SPSS, R, and SAS. Among them, the Statistical Programming (1) subject of learning SAS was the most difficult. I was not familiar with the coding language, so I had a hard time writing the script myself, and eventually I got a grade called c+. Although I was frustrated with my low grades, I realized that I was lacking in my capacity and started to study further by myself. I acquired all my certificates at once without fail, and I was able to have confidence in dealing with the statistical package called SAS. I worked on statistical analysis and customer process improvement proposal for 2 billion global customers of OOOOOO, a client company, at a consulting firm called ""Intern but in charge of One Brand OOO,"" and achieved achievement in charge of one brand, OOOOO, although I am an intern with fast adaptability and strong responsibility. When I was told that a program called Netizen used SQL language to extract data before joining the company, I focused on studying MYSQL and studying what are the most efficient queries I learned in my undergraduate days. As a result, I was able to quickly adapt to my work, take on unscheduled customer analysis tasks, and provide direct analysis services to customer companies. During my internship, the most passionate task was to write an 'Indepth Report' that analyzed purchase data. What was regrettable about writing various reports related to promotions and membership was that the analysis technique using statistical programming was not introduced to the company. When analyzing data on the subject of ""strong product experience rate"", R was introduced to analyze the correlation, and a strategy was proposed to induce CROSS-SELLING by applying rules with high improvement and reliability. By using the new statistical programming, we were able to provide in-depth reports to our customers and receive positive feedback. I felt aptitude and interested in the job of finding insights with these customers' purchase data and establishing a better strategy, and I would like to present detailed recommended products and strategies to GS SHOP customers using my various statistical analysis skills. Mentoring, which I participated in for a year of ""87 Hours of Mentoring"", was difficult for me, but it is an experience that I realized the true meaning of giving and feeling the most proud. I made a relationship with two students through the OO project, and I wanted to help them improve their grades as I am a low-income student who cannot attend private tutoring or private academies. I organized the data I collected while working part-time at the academy and provided them to students, and I gave them answers to problems I did not know through messenger. After the scheduled service period of one semester ended, the students expressed to their teacher that they wanted to receive mentoring from me next year when they will be their third year of high school. I was worried because I had a new part-time job scheduled and had a plan to be faithful to my studies, but I thought it would be of unforgettable help to mentees who are taking the test, so I extended my service period by one more semester. As a result, the students' grades improved remarkably and the teacher recommended me as an excellent mentor with a responsible appearance for a year. I felt a lot from the words of students who said, ""I had a lot of problems I didn't know, but you were a great help."" I realized the true meaning of giving and the responsible behavior is that I can give trust and trust to people. Even after joining GS SHOP, I will participate in various social contribution activities in the company and try to complete my work with responsible actions. ""Short term: Convergence and Data Understanding"" After joining the company, I will first greet you in order to harmonize well with the company. My boss and colleagues at work are my second family. I will always greet my bosses who spend a lot of time together with me with a smile first and deliver my energetic energy. I will also understand the company's database and processes accurately. The data that GS SHOP has accumulated over the years is a valuable business resource for the company. As a new employee, I will learn how to understand the system and deal with the data without making any mistakes rather than just trying to deal with the data right away. I will study the distribution and logistics knowledge that I lack in ""Medium-term: Understanding Distribution and Logistics Systems."" By analyzing customer characteristics, I will try to contribute to all tasks by not only analyzing data such as product recommendation but also sales forecast using big data and product defect prediction in the logistics process. ""Long-term: Improving Global Capabilities"" In order to grow GS SHOP, which was selected as a professional trading company in the home shopping industry for the first time in March this year, I will try to study the language and understand the trends and tendencies of the countries in which I entered. During the internship period, I analyzed the results of launching China's Innisfree app. As a platform called ""WeChat"" is strongly established in China, we found that it has a lower number of app downloads and utilization rates than other Asian countries. GS SHOP will establish data analysis and strategies that take into account the characteristics of each country in order to successfully enter various overseas markets."
"I have the thought of ""challenge, gain after learning, my own asset"" and ""learning every experience in life,"" so I always enjoy passionately challenging myself. When I was a college student, I worked as an assistant to OOO applications for 3,000 companies in Seoul. As a part-time job, I always recorded the company name, number, and delivery details after phone consultation to prepare for misinformation delivery. While checking the records, I confirmed that I delivered the wrong information to the company. And after contacting the person in charge, I corrected the information to prevent accidents. Through this experience, I learned not only meticulousness and responsibility in handling work, but also relationships with people and harmony. Although it was a trivial experience, the positive idea of learning allowed me to take on a responsible challenge by releasing the burden of every experience. As a result, I was able to develop many abilities of myself, which soon became a valuable asset for me. Challenging passionately is the most valuable value that has created various assets for me, and I am still creating new ones. ""From the First to the Best"" Currently, K-Bank is Korea's first Internet company, and it is positioned noteworthy in the global market. It ignited my potential passion by seeing him try something no one expected first and always run for the best. I have a goal to show my passion to challenge and explore new things without hesitation at K-Bank. We will provide convenient and easy services to more customers through constant inquiry and research. We will strive to be recognized as the best company in the global market by enhancing customer satisfaction and establishing a foothold to expand into the world. I will not be complacent but develop creative and innovative thinking through constant self-development so that I can have an eye for the future. With such an active attitude and passion, I will become a talented person who can take responsibility for K-Bank's bright future by transforming into a multi-talented expert. ""Analist? Developer?"" When I was working as an intern in beauty e-commerce, I led the project responsibly and meticulously so that I could not recognize that I was an intern in the collaboration department. Log data loading was attempted for customer behavior analysis, and the project was carried out. It was a task that required a great sense of responsibility because my plan determines the accuracy of data, the workload of the collaboration department, and the quality of analysis. We started communicating with an emphasis on how the development work would be efficient and how analysis would be more convenient. At first, there were mistakes, but thanks to communicating with responsibility, the collaboration department trusted and followed the plan and wanted to be with us in the future. Since the work efficiency of many people was determined by my plan, I worked with a great sense of responsibility, and it was an opportunity to be recognized for my expertise with that sense of responsibility. In addition, various customer behavior analysis was attempted based on the planned data. After various analyzes such as customer purchase funnel, UX/UI analysis, and app usability, the biggest insight I gained was one. The purpose of all the analysis at the company was to attract new users or prevent existing users from leaving. Changes such as better usability and platform-only service provision were all aimed at increasing the length of stay because customers were satisfied with our service. In general, new users were more than twice as likely to leave within a short period of time as existing users. Therefore, we found that preventing existing users from leaving was an effective strategy in the limited budget plan rather than attracting new users. He has high competencies in data analysis and engineering as a contest and intern, and has a general understanding of marketing and development fields through the progress of previous projects. I believe that a general understanding from development and data processing to the marketing stage that applies it will be a great strength in performing the task. Based on a general understanding of the industry and work, we will create new thoughts and creative values within K-Bank by understanding colleagues as well as understanding customers. Through collaboration to understand the other party's ""value created by collaboration,"" I have experience in solving problems and achieving successful results. In the big data marketing competition, analysts and marketers collaborated based on their understanding of each other to smoothly proceed with the competition and had a chance to win the prize in the competition. In addition, I communicated with about 40 people in charge of marketing, development, and engineering teams when I was working as an intern at a small and medium-sized company, and led and successfully completed the project under the title of an intern. This result could have been attributed not to simple collaboration but to the attitude of understanding the collaborating colleagues and trying to communicate with them sincerely. Communication is an important factor in the process of creating value through data and is the most basic element of continuing cooperative relationships with partners throughout the job. I want to add unique value to K-Bank through my strengths in strong analysis and communication skills. ""Creating new paths, new definitions"" people always want to know what they don't know, know more, and explain what they know. The unknown X in the equation is the number of freedom that makes it possible to explain this desire. People continue to strive to find answers to undefined unknown, and the launch of K-Bank is the primary outcome and future of efforts to find answers. As a financial-IT convergence talent, I will inspire new and diverse thoughts in K-Bank. A departure from finance can be defined as a banking termination, but a departure from an Internet-only bank can be defined as the last day of use of the page and marketing can be carried out. As it is the first Internet-only bank, a different idea and definition are needed to create new value.K-Bank, which was born through constant effort, and a variable called me, who is creative and not afraid of challenges, will form an equation to create a creative unknown X that no one expected."
"As an analytical consumer in return for behavioral analysis, I was delighted in analyzing information and delivering it to others. And I was very interested in observing and predicting how customers' responses changed before and after information was delivered. In order to increase the accuracy of the information to be presented to customers, I have increased my statistical ability. In addition, I have invested time generously in participating in external activities, contests, and internships in order to utilize this in practice. In the process of realizing these dreams, I participated in an internship and strengthened my commitment to joining the game industry. We analyzed the behavioral data of 3 million members through leading data planning and analysis during my internship at a commerce company and conducted an analysis of the behavioral data of online shopping customers. Until then, I did not think that online customers' behavior would respond as a result of various factors such as departure and inflow, influenced by the subtleties and trivial experiences. However, through the analysis process, I found it very attractive to understand changes in user behavior. As a result, in order to understand more detailed customer behavior in the field of games that make up another society online, we have firmly established our willingness to work in the game industry. By incorporating my wishes and strengths into my duties, I want to create a game that anyone can enjoy easily and interestingly, and a game that everyone can enjoy together. I will not be complacent but develop creative thinking and innovative thinking through constant self-improvement so that I can have an eye for the future. With such an active attitude and passion, I want to create a world where I become one by transforming into a multi-savvy professional as well as a professional. ""Short Introduction of the Kakao Games Developer Conference Leave Session Leadership"" Hello, I am a new employee who will be presenting the KDC Game Leave Session. I am very proud and nervous to present the results of my research here five years ago after the determination and effort to grow into an analyst. When I first joined the company, I realized the importance of exploratory analysis, and I had a habit that I did not neglect and an attitude that I always tried to learn new things by making efforts. Data processing and exploratory analysis were important preparations that laid the foundation for all analyses, which provided a solid foundation for my analysis. In addition, I was able to broaden my knowledge of statistics and new technologies by utilizing education and books within the company. And through in-house and outside lectures, I shared data on the analysis and made it my own. The important thing in analysis is not algorithms, but how to create a good learning set. So, because sharing opportunities are more important, I have participated in many conferences since I was a student, and after joining the company, I have volunteered as a speaker. Now, in the first year after I joined Kakao Games as an intern, I have laid the foundation for game analysis, and through this process of effort, the decision to conduct a successful departure analysis that I vaguely dreamed of in the past has become a reality, leading to the development of an R package with a higher prediction rate than in the past. This passion could greatly contribute to the success of our company's game. I think that the field of analysis is an area where the subject of analysis is endless and the field of analysis is endless. So, my future plan will still be to conduct departure analysis with a high prediction rate to achieve perfect modeling. And I want to create a game that anyone can easily enjoy by analyzing customer behavior by game genre, such as the impact of early experience on users, gamebot and abnormal user detection modeling, increasing marketing efficiency in the game process, and increasing customer behavior in each game genre. I'm very excited because it's my first time holding it. I will also present the departure analysis and the R package development process with burning passion. I acknowledged the failure of ""growing attitude on experience"" and tried to find the cause and use it as the basis for my growth. I participated in L company's contest and directly implemented and attempted the predictive modeling of personalized product recommendation. At this time, our team focused on what technique to use for modeling. After classifying groups by gender and age based on the basic analysis, we modeled them using the Apriori algorithm. However, the result was a prize winning failure. Unfortunately, our team did not leave it as a failure, but tried to find the cause of the failure and use it as a springboard for growth. The cause of the failure was that the data processing and exploration analysis had not been properly established due to the lack of data processing and exploration analysis, so I realized that the result prediction rate was lower than that of the winning team. Through the lessons learned from this experience, I tried to analyze thoroughly without neglecting the exploration analysis before doing all the analysis. In addition, in order not to make the same mistakes as before, I worked hard to acquire statistical knowledge, read various papers, participated in the AWS Summit, R Conference, and NDC to understand the current status of analysis in various fields. Based on the efforts made above, I have experience in identifying the behavior of customers who left during the internship process of a commerce company and reflecting them in marketing. After joining the company, I tried various things such as the main indicators used by the company, the customer's purchase funnel, UX/UI analysis, the customer's application usability, and purchase analysis. In the process of the above analysis, I found that the main purpose of all analyses at the company was to attract new users or prevent the departure of existing users. At that time, the marketing team was conducting marketing actions to users who left, and I decided to set a clearer text messaging standard for this, so I decided to decide on the subject of the analysis project. First, I tried an exploratory analysis to define the most important departure and how to classify customers. And I analyzed the life cycle of customers based on the Cox PH model by referring to the papers I was interested in at the time. As a result, we identified the timing of departure for new subscribers by characteristics. When marketing to active users, this was used to set the text sending period and increased the text opening rate of target users.This success was possible because, as a result of not neglecting the exploratory analysis, it was possible to define deviations from the exact criteria and classify customer groups. As a result, I was able to proceed with a feasible analysis that was used in actual marketing, not just a task. Analysis is an important field that affects all departments and plans in the company. Therefore, I think the attitude of acknowledging failure and taking it as a lesson is particularly important. The reason I can be here now is because of my attitude to constantly improve based on failure. I hope you remember that I am always challenging and striving to attempt a feasible analysis based on this attitude. The tasks of ""real-life talents, behavioral talents"" have always been successfully accomplished with a sense of responsibility and action. The Golden Bell School Volunteer Group conducted a career education experience that conveyed big data to middle school students through board games. At that time, since it was the first volunteer group, there was a problem that the organization time for game tools was prolonged due to the lack of foundation for progress. To correct this, I carefully observed each class process, found improvements, and immediately reflected them to examine the effect. With the improvements accumulated after several observations and attempts, I was able to reduce unnecessary time and distribute tasks clearly. As a result, the additional organization time was reduced from 40 minutes to 0 minutes. This gave the volunteers the joy of solving problems, and the joy of the volunteers soon led to the student's satisfaction, doubling their impression. These results could come from my behavioral and adaptability. I have always tried to implement any challenges without hesitation. This attitude not only brought about the foundation of the volunteer group, but I was also able to successfully complete the project with quick work adaptability during my internship. I would like to emphasize that this can be demonstrated along with my job skills in my internship activities at Kakao Games, which can further contribute to the creation of the company's value."
"As an analytical consumer, I felt pleasure in analyzing information and delivering it to others. And I dreamed of becoming a data analyst to deliver this joy to customers. I have increased my statistical capabilities to enhance the accuracy of the information to be presented to customers. In addition, I have invested time generously in participating in external activities and contests to utilize them in practice. I thought that a company that will realize my dream is a company that provides opportunities for challenge and innovation for corporate growth and customer impressions. Hanwha Life Insurance is a company that provides opportunity for growth. Currently, Hanwha Life Insurance is leading the life insurance industry by strengthening its capabilities in various fields to create food for the future. Breaking away from the existing business processing method, customers can handle about 70 insurance businesses with just one application. I chose Hanwha Life Insurance because I think the challenge and innovation going forward comes from opportunity for growth in various fields. Big data analysis is an area where opportunity for new fields is especially important. First, I will join a company and extract KPI from its DB. This is because grasping the basic data the company needs and currently uses first is the stepping stone to in-depth analysis results. After that, I will learn and implement machine learning and deep learning through various experiences and learning opportunities provided by the company. Through CS data, we will quickly identify customer complaints and build a system to prevent them. We will build a dataset that can create insurance products that customers really want through insurance data. Through app data, we will improve customer usability and identify behavior to find new food. As a result of these challenges, we will lead the innovation of life insurance companies by planning customized products only for Hanwha Life Insurance customers. My strength is the experience of leading the project and meticulously analyzing large-scale data directly, so that collaborative departments could not recognize that I was an intern. Based on the data I planned, I tried various customer analysis. I tried various attempts, such as customer purchase funnel, UX/UI analysis, customer app usability, and purchase analysis, and after all analysis, the biggest insight I gained was one. The company found that the purpose of all analysis was to attract new users or prevent the departure of existing users. In general, new users were about twice as likely to leave within a short period of time as existing users. Therefore, it was found that preventing the departure of existing users is an effective strategy in the limited budget rather than attracting new users. Customer departure from insurance can be defined as insurance cancellation in one dimension, but in reality, I think that defining it as the frequency of occurrence of specific actions when the termination date approaches is a sophisticated definition to reduce the dropout rate. As such, I was interested in predicting customer behavior before the incident and reducing customer complaints through prediction, so I chose the field. Based on the previous attempts, we will find the factors that influence customer departure. As a result, we will contribute to the value creation of Hanwha Life by increasing customer satisfaction by preventing departure. ""Strict sense of goal out of responsibility"" When I was a college part-time job, I was in charge of OOO applications to more than 3,000 companies in Seoul. I didn't ask anyone to do it, but I always recorded the company name, number, and delivery information after phone consultation to prepare for misinformation delivery as it was my first time doing a company task. It was my first time in charge of this task, so I felt a lot of pressure and worry, but I worked with strict standards to overcome the pressure with a responsible attitude. First, I looked at the records, explained what I inquired about often and what to note when receiving them, and then organized the details by e-mail again. After that, I checked the documents to see if they were received without errors and called the person in charge of the company. The phone call to thank the company manager for his meticulousness and responsibility became a memorable experience. The passion and responsible attitude for work were the most decisive factors that achieved a document reception error rate of 0% and attracted the satisfaction of corporate customers who visited the industrial complex. Through this experience, I was able to learn not only about meticulousness and responsibility in handling work, but also about relationships with people and harmony with people. I think the above attitude is essential in conducting an analysis based on data. Although it was a trivial experience, the strict sense of goal with responsibility enabled me to tackle challenges that everyone was satisfied with. As a result, I was able to develop many of my own abilities, which soon became my valuable asset and I am still making new assets. Based on the valuable assets I saw and felt in the field, I will bring innovation to the future of Hanwha Life. I have experience in solving problems and successfully leading data projects through communication between the ""Understanding Communication, Adding Value"" collaboration departments. When I was working as an intern at a commerce company, I led a log data design and tagging project. However, during the start of the project, the marketing team and development team, which are the collaboration departments, did not feel the need for the project. So, I tried to communicate with the position of each person in charge to solve this problem. First, I explained the advantages that I would gain from the project. The marketing team explained what can be obtained from the data and what information can be obtained from the development team. And I tried to communicate with the development team and understand the development language, focusing on how the work should be handled to be efficient. Through this process, the collaboration department understood the necessity of work, and understood each other's work methods, thereby increasing work efficiency.As a result of communication with each other, the log data was constructed about two weeks earlier than expected. Although it was a project led by the internship, the attitude of understanding each department and trying to communicate with others became a decisive factor in completing the project successfully. This gave me an opportunity to identify one of my strengths. Through this process, I realized that analysts had to think not only about accurate analysis ability but also about the data and work method required by collaborative departments. Communication is an important factor in the process of creating value through data, and it is the most basic factor in continuing a cooperative relationship with partners in all jobs. I want to add unique value to Hanwha's life through my strengths with solid analysis and communication skills."
"1. Completion Classes - Department Course: Data Mining, Statistical Programming, Data Analysis Theory, Categorical Data Analysis, Time Series Analysis, Regression - Out-of-school Course: Big Data Social Marketing Professional Training Course (Completion Period: 2016 - 06 - 27 - 2016 - 11 - 11 - 11) - Online Course: T-Academy Big Data Online Course, Coding Night School - Participation in Seminar - APAC Machine Learning, Data Science Community Summit / Enforcement Date: May 20 - Tableau Basic Education / Enforcement Date: June 9 - Watson Explorer Solution for the use of unstructured big data / Enforcement Date: July 25 I have the idea of 'All experiences in life learn' deeply, so I always enjoy passionately challenging myself. On the way to and from school, I always had something in my hand. It was paper with something printed on it, not a cell phone. As I went through the path of an analyst, I thought it was important to understand not only simple theories but also practical applications and current data directions. In addition, I participated in a contest for hands-on training and handled data from various fields. I think the most important thing for an analyst is a challenging attitude to move forward. I want to contribute to the development of modern cards by constantly learning and challenging myself to derive creative insights. 1. Project Topic: Log Data Planning / Data Standardization Personnel: 2 Period January 2017 to March 2017 Role: Data Planning and Project Leading Project Content: Present a guide to the direction of log data accumulation to enable more detailed customer behavior analysis away from Google Analytics. Data structure is consistent for data standardization in Korea, the United States and China. 2. Project Topic: Customer behavior analysis through App/Web reorganization Personnel: 1 Period April 2017 to August 2017 Role of responsibility: Analysis of customer behavior by App Tab Based on the accumulated log data, I took the initiative in the project based on the changed customer behavior analysis through the screen reorganization. When I was working as an intern at a commerce company, I led the project responsibly and meticulously led the collaboration department so that they could not recognize me as an intern. The company attempted to load log data using a segment tool for detailed customer behavior analysis, and led the data planning. Because my plan determines the accuracy of data, the workload of the collaboration department, and the quality of analysis, it was a task that required responsibility above all else. I started communicating with an emphasis on how the development work would be efficient and how to plan it to be more convenient for analysis. At first, I made mistakes because I was inexperienced, but thanks to communicating responsibly, the collaboration department trusted and followed my plan and wanted me to join in the next project. Because the work efficiency of many people was determined by my plan, I worked with a great responsibility, and it was an opportunity to be recognized for my expertise with that responsibility. In addition, I tried various customer behavior analysis based on the data I planned myself. Various attempts were made, such as customer purchase funnel, UX/UI analysis, customer app usability, and purchase analysis, and after all analysis, the biggest insight I gained was one. The company found that the main purpose of all analysis was to attract new users or prevent the departure of existing users. In general, new users were more than twice as likely to leave within a short period of time than existing users. Therefore, it was found that preventing the departure of existing users was an effective strategy in the limited budget rather than attracting new users. Customer departure from the card can be defined as card cancellation in one dimension, but in reality, I think it is a sophisticated definition to reduce the departure rate by defining how long it has passed since the last card payment date. Based on the previous attempts, we will find the factors that influence customer departure. As a result, we will contribute to the company's value creation by establishing a customer's repayment system by preventing departure and improving usability by increasing the active users of Hyundai Card."
"When I was in charge of the project with the theme of ""responsibility to fulfill my role"" corporate security, I collected the opinions of the team members and divided the roles. In the beginning, all the team members faithfully performed their duties, but as time passed, they remained silent. In the end, the completeness of the mid-term inspection was inferior to that of the other groups, and I couldn't even answer the professor's questions. After the presentation, we shared our opinions on the inadequacies. All of the team members said that they lacked the information they needed and were less interested than expected. So, I promoted a corporate tour of a venture company and an IT security company. However, it was rejected because it was an important factor in the life and death of the company. However, I was not discouraged by the failure and started to look for other ways. Just in time, I heard that the World IT Show is holding a special exhibition on industrial security. I was able to meet my team members and solve my questions and have a direct experience with security products and new technologies while conducting an interview with them. I completed the project by building a sense of intimacy and increasing participation in a short period of time. After joining the company, I will use this experience to become a talented person who is responsible for my role. I always plan and proceed with anything, putting importance on the principle of ""insufficient flexibility."" As a result, I hear a lot among my friends that I am well informed. There are many times when things go smoothly with thorough preparation and planning, but when the plan goes awry due to unexpected things, they often get twisted. Therefore, I will increase my flexibility by listening to the people around me. Whenever there is a disruption in the performance of the job, I will come up with a variety of next-line measures by combining the opinions of all members. I will become a talented person who can handle any crisis skillfully and perform successfully. ""Development experience of catching two rabbits"" I learned various programming languages such as C, C++, and Java in each grade, and I became interested in developing and started the Arduino project. I decided to develop a trash can management page because I noticed the problem of trash cans that usually overflowed with trash. I was proud because I did it by myself from purchasing materials necessary for development to building DBs and servers. In particular, the experience of solving the network failure caused by building a server with IP on campus was the most memorable. At that time, professors and seniors also recommended receiving new IP addresses in the computer room. However, I understood the structure of the network and solved the problem by newly designating DNS. As a completed work, I received an A in the development project course, and in conjunction with the classroom wastebasket, I managed to reduce collection costs through efficient management. ""Nothing happens next time."" Whatever I did, I always had lingering feelings. However, it was foolish to have lingering feelings. The report card I received after the SAT was insignificant, and it remained in my mind when I went to college. Eventually, I took a leave of absence from my college and started taking the second try. However, the problem was that I had an insurance policy called leave of absence, not dropout. I lacked the three letters "" sense of urgency,"" and a year becomes a waste of time. After that, I felt the need to drain away whatever happened. To devote yourself only to it, leaving only one option. My first attempt is regret over a ruined first-year subject. Two days before taking the C language test, I exchanged my major books for one meal with my junior. I devoted myself to the test thinking that there was no next time, and as a result, I was able to get an A+. Of course, there were not always good results. However, I am sure that this is the way to do my best. I will always work with the attitude that this is the last one, and I will do my best. I think it is important to put the customer's assets and information first as much as developing a system tailored to the business status of the customer. I want to manage and operate the network and system infrastructure at the contact center and encounter various errors and infringement incidents. I will work hard to establish a security system based on my experience as a system engineer. To this end, I will conduct systematic and continuous information protection activities. I will establish a defense policy by analyzing past hacking cases, subscribe to major security reports such as Cisco, Symantec, and KISA on a regular basis, and acquire new technologies and security information. I will acquire an information security technician within one year after joining the company to improve my ability to check the safety of the built system. Within five years, I will acquire CISSP and CISA to gain international-level security technology capabilities and contribute to acquiring ISMS certification marks. Thus, I will be reborn as the representative security expert of Hanil Networks."
"When I was a child, I hit my head on a stone's throw while riding a bicycle. It was a big accident that could stain my whole body with blood, and after that, I became afraid of the bicycle. Then, last year, I put my foot back on the pedal with a 'some trigger'. I want to talk about overcoming trauma and being able to ride a bicycle again. I took Internet security and built a network using routers. I configured and redistributed dynamic and static routing tables, and built a firewall using Linux. The security network analyzed packets in real time and performed defense activities such as firewall settings and policy settings. In the information security curriculum, I tested and organized Carolynux's simulated hacking tool. In particular, I established security measures by analyzing the results of sniffing and Dos. The UTM equipment set actual web servers and firewall rules and focused on the WAF function. Through log analysis, it was confirmed that Injection and XSS attacks were blocked. Based on solid basic skills, we will perform quick and reliable tasks. In the event of an infringement accident, we will not just end with defense, but analyze the attack and update the operation policy with the acquired security information to ensure the stability of the system. With the know-how accumulated while working for KT, we will be reborn as a leader in security in the upcoming 5G era."
"""Challenge if there is anything you want"" After finishing my first year of university, I have previous experiences. I think it is the result of my skepticism and sincerity about the previous major, which I applied for according to my grades when the SAT exam was over, and my passion to try after knowing what I wanted. I think the first year I was the most passionate and devoted year in my life. It was a year that made me realize that it was the most precious choice in my life. With my passion and momentum, I have been able to focus on my major study well up to now. ""The Value of Together"" I have experience in field training at the National Research Institute during the summer vacation last year. I worked with one of the doctors in charge, and I learned that my doctor was in the same school as me and majored in similar computer science. He taught me the importance of responsibility and willingness to develop in learning and utilizing my major. Even if I finish work late every day, I have a lot of thoughts that if I have a job in the future, I will perform my duties with this person. I was able to learn a lot of practical knowledge while working on programming together, and I think it was a rewarding experience. ""Trust and Patience"" I have experience in office/administrative volunteer work at the Daegu OOOOO Center from September 2016 to March 2017. I went to the center once a week and conducted office work-oriented volunteer work. Mainly, I used the Excel program and Korean programs to manage class attendance and training hours and contents of foreign workers. In addition, when there was a big event in the center, I faithfully volunteered in the lowest position through additional work. It was my first experience while living in a place called work. Experiencing a well-organized position system gave me an opportunity to understand the division of work and the overall process according to positions. Through smooth communication with the people I worked for, I was able to leave a good impression. Through this experience, I realized two things. First, the importance of time commitment. I think it is the most important to keep a good time promise when working. I think sincerity and trust come out when you keep a good time promise. Second, you have to not give up your duties and finish them patiently. I tried to handle the task given to me by meeting the deadline as much as possible. I thought that if the back worker took over the task that I couldn't do, the amount of work could cause me to feel burdened, so I tried my best to handle the task. ""Response to Change, Design for People"" When I was an undergraduate, my interest in and interest in major in programming and database increased. I was able to experience firsthand the way a line of code from my hand makes a difference, and my interest in IT could be amplified. Through this, I was able to think about endless applications and collect information. I have experience working on a comprehensive design capstone design project in the last semester of the fourth grade. The topic of our group's choice is 'Child Protection Area Vehicle Safety Surveillance System'. The convergence of automobiles and IT, and just thinking about it, it was an attractive topic, and I focused on design day and night for a successful project. Eventually, a module that could be demonstrated was completed, and satisfactory results were obtained. Through this experience, I have grown eager to utilize IT knowledge in automobile-related industries in the future. If I go to practice in the future, I would like to work on ERP and database. This is because it is the most closely related to real life and development is possible for people. Based on my major knowledge, I would like to be helpful for the job of automotive computing. Since ""Aiming to a Global Leader,"" Automotive is a global company with 23 production plants and 4 technical research institutes in 9 countries. I tried to develop my global capabilities by constantly learning English and checking foreign materials related to my major. In addition, I was attracted to Automotive's management ideology and applied because it was new and rewarding. After experiencing two field trips and an administrative intern, I was able to think about the value of working together. I want to continue working with automotive by remembering the sense of accomplishment when I get new challenges and rewarding results. As a member of my computer work, I will never stop having strong major knowledge and constant self-development. Changes in the IT field are endless and accelerating with the Fourth Industrial Revolution. I will continue to understand the learning and the job in order not to be eliminated. If I join the automotive computing job after ""customer-centered IT planning and operation"", I would like to take charge of IT planning and construction considering the situation of customers and business parties. Big data and the latest IT technologies are pouring in following the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Accordingly, it is necessary to quickly accept information and make appropriate use of it. Through constant self-improvement, I thoroughly learned foreign languages and am exposed to the latest IT-related technologies through regular online news subscriptions. Here, I will make use of my major knowledge to become a talented person with expertise. One year after joining the company, I have experienced two industry-academic and one administrative intern. I will try to adapt quickly, recalling my adaptability and communication skills at that time. For five years after joining the company in the ""10 years after joining the company,"" I will add to my expertise by obtaining an information management technician license. In addition, I will put into practical projects to produce practical results. I will grow into a 10-year middle manager and become an automotive person who is full of humanity, encompassing seniors and juniors."
